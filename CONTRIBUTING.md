This class reader is a collaborative project and EVERY reasonable input will improve the quality of the reader. 

The class reader is the virtual extension of the classroom. You use the class reader to collaboratively develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual and technical fundamentals of data visualization. 

Your objective is to contribute in a meaningful way to the class reader on a weekly basis. Meaningful contribution is defined as the following set of activities:

* Add and annotate a unique reference to the class reader. The annotation should consist of a short summary of the key points, a critical analysis, and a personal reflection.
* Write a component of the class reader that combines several annotated references in a useful manner. 
* Evaluate and critique an existing component of the class reader.
* Substantially improve an existing component of the class reader.
* Organize components into coherent and consistent structures (chapters, sub-chapters, tables, lists).

When contributing to the class reader, make sure that you understand the requirements of academic integrity as outlined in the syllabus.
