This class reader is a collaborative project and EVERY reasonable input will improve the quality of the reader. 

#Objective
The class reader is the virtual extension of the classroom. You use the class reader to collaboratively develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual and technical fundamentals of data visualization. 

#Objective
Your objective is to contribute in a meaningful way to the class reader on a weekly basis. Meaningful contribution is defined as the following set of activities:

1. Add and annotate a unique reference to the class reader. The annotation should consist of a short summary of the key points, a critical analysis, and a personal reflection.
2. Write a component of the class reader that combines several annotated references in a useful manner. 
3. Organize components into coherent and consistent structures (chapters, sub-chapters, tables, lists).
4. Substantially improve an existing component of the class reader.
5. Evaluate and critique an existing component of the class reader.

When contributing to the class reader, make sure that you understand the requirements of academic integrity as outlined in the syllabus. 

#Structure
The repository has two main branches:
* master
* contributions

The master branch contains the weekly published updates of the book.
The contributions branch contains the lastest state of the book. Each Saturday, all contributions in the contributions branch will be merged into master and tagged with the week number.

Additionally, each contributor will create branches that reflect the specific contributions. These branches should reflect the specific contribution:
* reference-* (see 1. above)
* component-* (see 2. above)
* org-* (see 3. above)
* improve-* (see 4. above)

When you start working on your contribution, you have to create a branch from the contributions branch.

When you are finished with your contribution (do not forget to commit regularly), you have to create a pull request to the contributions branch.


#How add content to the reader (1,2,3,5)
You add content by **creating a new branch** that you use to include your contribution and then open a **pull request** to the master branch:

1. Create a new branch for your contribution:
