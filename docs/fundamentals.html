<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> A Brief History of Data Visualization</h3>
<p>“The only new thing in the world is the history you don’t know.” — Harry S Truman</p>
<p>This paper provides an overview of the intellectual history of data visualization from medieval to modern times, it describes and illustrates some significant advances along the way.</p>
<p><strong>1. Data Visualization: Modern Product?</strong></p>
<p>It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots.These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields.</p>
<p>Developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content.</p>
<p><strong>2. Milestones Tour</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams</strong></p>
<p>Data visualization has comes a long way. Prior to the 17th century, data visualization already exists. Though display in other format such as maps, the content are much similar to today’s visualization, which mostly presented geologic, economic, and medical data. Here is useful link: [data_viz_history]</p>
<p>The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 1600-1699: Measurement and theory</strong></p>
<p>Among the most important problems of the 17th century were those concerned with physical measurement of time, distance, and space for astronomy, surveying, map making, navigation and territorial expansion. This century also saw great new growth in theory and the dawn of practical application.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 1700-1799: New graphic forms</strong></p>
<p>With some rudiments of statistical theory, data of interest and importance, and the idea of graphic representation at least somewhat established, the 18th century witnessed the expansion of these aspects to new domains and new graphic forms.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 1800-1850: Beginnings of modern graphics</strong></p>
<p>With the fertilization provided by the previous innovations of design and technique, the first half of the 19th century witnessed explosive growth in statistical graphics and thematic mapping, at a rate which would not be equalled until modern times.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 1850–1900: The Golden Age of statistical graphics</strong></p>
<p>By the mid-1800s, all the conditions for the rapid growth of visualization had been established a “perfect storm” for data graphics. Official state statistical offices were established throughout Europe, in recognition of the growing importance of numerical information for social planning,industrialization, commerce, and transportation.</p>
<p>2.5.1 Escaping flatland<br />
2.5.2 Graphical innovations<br />
2.5.3 Galton’s contributions<br />
2.5.4 Statistical Atlases</p>
<p><strong>2.6 1900-1950: The modern dark ages</strong></p>
<p>If the late 1800s were the “golden age” of statistical graphics and thematic cartography, the early 1900s can be called the “modern dark ages” of visualization. There were few graphical innovations, and, by the mid-1930s, the enthusiasm for visualization which characterized the late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of quantification and formal, often statistical, models in the social sciences.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 1950–1975: Re-birth of data visualization</strong></p>
<p>Still under the influence of the formal and numerical zeitgeist from the mid-1930s on, data visualization began to rise from dormancy in the mid 1960s.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 1975–present: High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualization</strong></p>
<p>During the last quarter of the 20th century data visualization has blossomed into a mature, vibrant and multi disciplinary research area, as may be seen in this Handbook, and software tools for a wide range of visualization methods and data types are available for every desktop computer.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> <strong>Practitioners Guide to Best Practices in Data Visualization</strong></h2>
<p><span class="citation">(J.Camm and Shaffer <a href="#ref-best-practice">2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and then focus your visualization with respect to those questions.</p>
<p>Brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways �? unconscious (System 1 represents uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 �? represents controlled function such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System -1 which has can have quick and correct impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows: -</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Design and layout matter The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer.</li>
<li>Avoid Clutter Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio �? the ratio of ink required to convey the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That means, avoid ink which do not add any information.</li>
<li>Use color purposely and effectively Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists in conveying your message. The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above principles.And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.</li>

<li>The dashboard should read left to right.</li>
<li>Group related information together.</li>
<li>Find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blogs : Here is a list of the top 10 blogs that Tableau itself suggests following:</p>
<p><strong>1.Balance:</strong><br />
A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color, shape, texture, and negative spaceare uniformly distributed.</p>
<p><strong>2.Emphasis:</strong><br />
Draw viewers attention towards important data by using key visual elements.</p>
<p><strong>3.Movement:</strong><br />
Ideally movement should mimic the way people usually read, starting at the top of the page, movingacross it, and then down. Movement can also be created by using complimentary colors to pull the user’s attentionacross the page.</p>
<p><strong>4.Pattern:</strong><br />
Patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or for sets of data that equal in value. Disrupting the pattern can also be effective in drawing viewers attention; it naturally draws curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>5.Repetition:</strong><br />
Relationships between sets of data can be communicated by repeating chart types, shapes, or colors.</p>
<p><strong>6.Proportion:</strong><br />
If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going look bigger. In data visualization, proportion can indicate the importance of data sets, along with the actual relationship between numbers.</p>
<p><strong>7.Rhythm:</strong><br />
A design has proper rhythm when the design elements create movement that is pleasing to the eye. If thedesign is not able to do so, rearranging visual elements may help.</p>
<p><strong>8.Variety:</strong><br />
Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>9.Unity:</strong><br />
Unity across design will happen naturally if all other design principles are implemented.</p>
<p>Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity as the design foundation of any work. If you want to take your data visualization from an everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the 9 principles of design from graphic designer Melissa Anderson’s article:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="design_principles"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualization distributed evenly. And it is important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc. that can affect the balance of the display.</p>
<p>Another closely related component to balance is variety, which could seem counter to balance, but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.</p>
<p>Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer’s experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.</p>
<p>Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through the nine principles of design in this article. From prior experience with art through photography, I understand it is the key to be concious of what I am drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</p>

<p>This article gives me a clear understanding of data mining and data visualization.</p>
<p>In Data Mining, there are different processes involve carrying out the data mining process such as data extraction, data management, data transformations, data pre-processing, etc. In Data Visualization, the primary goal is to convey the information efficiently and clearly without any deviations or complexities in the form of statistical graphs, information graphs, and plots. Also, the author listed the top 7 comparisons between data mining and data visualization, and 12 key differences between data mining and data visualization. After reading the article, you will have a very clear understanding of what are data mining and data visualization and the characters for those two techniques.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> 1. Theoretical background of data visualization</h2>
<p>1.1 History Data visualization has comes a long way. Prior to the 17th century, data visualization already exists. Though display in other format such as maps, the content are much similar to today’s visualization, which mostly presented geologic, economic, and medical data.</p>
<p>1.2 Current research: Deceptive visualizations Data visualization is a powerful communication tool to support arguments with numbers in a way that is accessible and engaging. More people than ever before are making their own charts and infographics, which is presenting a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading or downright deceptive data visualizations.</p>

<p>The only new thing in the world is the history you don’t know. �? Harry S Truman</p>
<p>2.1. Data Visualization: modern product?</p>
<p>It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots.These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields.Developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Practitioners’ Guide to Best Practices in Data Visualization</h3>
<p>These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and then focus your visualization with respect to those questions.</p>
<p>The brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways – unconscious (System 1 represents uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 – represents controlled function such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System 1 which can have a quick and correct impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Design and layout matter</strong><br />
The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid Clutter</strong><br />
Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio – the ratio of ink required to convey the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That means, avoid ink which do not add any information.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use color purposely and effectively</strong><br />
Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists in conveying your message.</p>
<p>The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above principles. And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Visualization and Graphics Principles to Refocus and Guide You</h3>
<p>Jonathon Corum is a graphics designer for The New York Times and he provided a very informative talk to a strictly scientific audience on how to create and design visualizations that explain material originally created for a certain audience, i.e. the scienctific community, but now is to be related to a different audience, (in his case, the readership of the Times or maybe the public at large). The talk is filled with examples and break downs of how he has moved from his base content to the final product, all of which are illuminative examples by themselves. There is also great power in the broader themes that he is trying to convey.</p>
<p>First, of course is knowing the audience that you are producing the work for, but even in this step, do not lose sight of the ultimate goal of conveying understanding, of explaining a concept. You are searching for a visual idea in your content that can be communicated to your audience. Some of the main highlights to help you make this connection with your audience involve:</p>
<p><strong>Focusing the attention:</strong><br />
What can be removed? Realize that consistency can help eliminate unecessary distractions. There may be a trade off between losing information but conveying the ultimate meaning more clearly. Label important things rather than relying on a legend, which requires the viewer to hold on to too much information at once.</p>
<p><strong>Involving your audience:</strong><br />
Give them opportunities to connect their own general knowledge on the topic. Use real world comparisons or examples to help build and relate context. Encourage comparisons and make this easy for the viewer to process and see.</p>
<p><strong>Explaining why:</strong><br />
Providing context, adding time sequence details, showing movement, change and mechanism will all guide your audience in connecting the dots and understanding the significance of what you are trying to communicate. 2.2. Milestones Tour</p>
<p>2.2.1 Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams</p>
<p>The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration.</p>
<p>2.2.2 1600-1699: Measurement and theory</p>
<p>Among the most important problems of the 17th century were those concerned with physical measurement�? of time,distance,and space�? for astronomy, surveying, map making, navigation and territorial expansion. This century also saw great new growth in theory and the dawnof practical application.</p>
<p>2.2.3 1700-1799: New graphic forms</p>
<p>With some rudiments of statistical theory, data of interest and importance, and the idea of graphic representation at least somewhat established, the 18th century witnessed the expansion of these aspects to new domains and new graphic forms.</p>
<p>2.2.4 1800-1850: Beginnings of modern graphics</p>
<p>With the fertilization provided by the previous innovations of design and technique, the first half of the 19th century witnessed explosive growth in statistical graphics and thematic mapping, at a rate which would not be equalled until modern times.</p>
<p>2.2.5 1850�?1900: The Golden Age of statistical graphics</p>
<p>By the mid-1800s, all the conditions for the rapid growth of visualization had been established�? a “perfect storm�? for data graphics. Official state statistical offices were established throughout Europe, in recognition of the growing importance of numerical information for social planning,industrialization, commerce, and transportation.</p>
<p>2.2.5.1 Escaping flatland 2.2.5.2 Graphical innovations 2.2.5.3 Galton’s contributions 2.2.5.4 Statistical Atlases</p>
<p>2.2.6 1900-1950: The modern dark ages</p>
<p>If the late 1800s were the “golden age�? of statistical graphics and thematic cartography, the early 1900s can be called the “modern dark ages�? of visualization. There were few graphical innovations, and, by the mid-1930s, the enthusiasm for visualization which characterized the late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of quantification and formal, often statistical, models in the social sciences.</p>
<p>2.2.7 1950�?1975: Re-birth of data visualization</p>
<p>Still under the influence of the formal and numerical zeitgeist from the mid-1930s on, data visualization began to rise from dormancy in the mid 1960s.</p>
<p>2.2.8 1975–present: High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualization</p>
<p>During the last quarter of the 20th century data visualization has blossomed into a mature, vibrant and multi disciplinary research area, as may be seen in this Handbook, and software tools for a wide range of visualization methods and data types are available for every desktop computer.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> 5. Data Visualization Tools</h2>
<p>Due to the rise of big data analytics, there has been an increased need for data visualization tools to help understand the data. Besides Tableau, there are several other software tools one can use for data visualization like Sisense, Plotly, FusionCharts, Highcharts, Datawrapper, and Qlikview. This article is from forbes and has a brief, clear introduction about these 7 powerful software options for data visualization. This could be helpful for future reference because for different purposes I may need to use different tools. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages and this article helps highlight them.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> is the most popular of the group and has many users. It is simple to use, making it easy to learn and can handle large datasets. Tableau can handle big data thanks to integration with database handling applications such as MySQL, Hadoop, and Amazon AWS.</p>
<p><strong>Qlikview</strong> is the main competitor to Tableau and is also quite popular. Qlikview is customizable and has a wide range of features which can be a double-edged sword. These features take more time to learn and get acquianted with. However, once one gets past the learning curve, they have a powerful tool at their disposal.</p>

<p>Lisa Rost’s article “What I learned recreating one chart using 24 tools” describes lessons learned from recreating one chart using many different data visualization tools. The author used apps Excel, Plotly, Easycharts, Google Sheets, Lyra, Highcharts, Tableau, Polestar, Quadrigram, Illustrator, RAW, and NodeBox, as well as charting libraries ggvis, Bokeh, Highcharts, ggplot2, Processing, NVD3, Seaborn, Vega, D3, matplotlib, Vega-Lite, and R. She links her github page on the project which details the dataset she used, containing the health expectancy in years as well as GDP per capita and population for about 200 countries in the year 2015, as well has her process and results of visualizing the data using each tool. However, in the article, she focuses on the main takeaways from the exercise, which was especially interesting in the context of our class discussion on different types of tools and their respective strengths. She also provides her own graphics to help illustrate her lessons learned.</p>
<p>Rost’s first takeaway: <strong>“There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Goals”</strong></p>
<p>Since data visualization is necessary in many spheres, from science to journalism, data visualization projects will often have quite disparate objectives, and the people working on them will have different requirements. And as the author aptly points out, it is impossible for one tool to satisfy the needs of every data visualizer; so there will necessarily be tools better suited to specific situations.</p>
<p>For example, does the user need a tool for exploratory visualization of the data, or does the user seek to create graphs and charts to show the public or a specific audience something?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/analysis_spectrum.png" />

</div>
<p>The author also notes that the flexibility of a tool is a sticking point as well—if you need to change your data while developing a data visualization, certain apps like Illustrator will not be ideal because changing the data even slightly requires you to build the graph again from scratch. Another thing to think about is the type of chart you are trying to create—is a basic, canned bar or line graph all you need (in which case something like Excel will do the trick), or does your project necessitate a more innovative or custom chart (like something possible in D3.js)? Interactivity is another big question—only certain tools will make this possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="pick-the-right-chart-type" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> Pick the Right Chart Type!</h3>
<p>Data visualization is a combination of art and science. When it comes to the artistic aspect, there are no correct answers for doing the visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, when making sense of facts, numbers, and measurement, better understanding is promoted by a logical path to follow.</p>
<p>To determine the best type of chart is hard for those new to data visulization. Most people learn it by referring to other people’s work without understanding the underlying logic, so they don’t have the theory in their mind to make the judgement. Here, I will introduce some guidance on how to select the best chart for the objective.</p>
<p>When we are choosing the type of chart, we need to answer some questions:<br />
- How many features would you like to show in a chart?<br />
- how many data points do you want to display for each variable?<br />
- Will you display time serious data or among items or groups.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/interactivity.png" />

</div>
<p>Rost’s next takeaway: <strong>“There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Mindsets”</strong></p>
<p>This section of the article is all about the difference in people’s preferences and opinions; from the people who build the tools to the users, everyone thinks differently. Therefore, certain tools will be inherently more intuitive to use for different people.</p>
<p>Let’s review the most commonly used chart types and explain the ideal circumstances for different types of charts and the pros and cons of each. Before introducing different types of charts, you can use the following reference to familiarize yourself with different types of charts. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="charts_viz"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p><strong>Type 1 Column Charts</strong><br />
This should be the most popular chart type. This chart is good to do comparison between different values when specific values are important. TBD Rost’s third lesson: <strong>“ We Still Live in an ‘Apps Are for the Easy Stuff, Code Is for the Good Stuff’ World”</strong> Basically, writing code can be scary for anyone without a coding background, but it provides more flexibility, and, as mentioned in class, code is perfectly reproducible. On the other hand, apps are much more user-friendly for the less computer science-savvy.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/apps_vs_code.png" />

</div>
<p>Rost’s final lesson: <strong>“‘Every Tool Forces You Down a Path’”</strong></p>
<p>Rost quotes her former NPR Visuals teammate for the final lesson header, pointing out that tools themselves influence the development of a data visualization with their respective features, strengths, and limitations.</p>

<div id="three-rules-to-follow-in-order-to-develop-intuitive-dashboards" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.3</span> Three Rules to Follow in order to Develop Intuitive Dashboards:</h3>
<p>Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead to effective presentation of the data.</p>
<p><strong>1. The dashboard should read left to right</strong><br />
Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader’s eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> 6. Pick the Right Chart Type</h2>
<p>Data divusalization is combining the art and science. As for the art, we can say there are no correct answers for doing the visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, how to making sense of facts, numbers and measurement for better understanding is still have a logical path to follow.</p>
<p>To determine which kind of chart is hard for those people new to data visulization. Most people learn it by refering some other people’s work without understanding the logic behind. So they don’t have the theory in their mind to make the judgement. Here , I will introduce some guidance to choose the charts.</p>
<p>When we about to choose the type of chart, we need to answer some questions. - How many features would you like to show in a chart? - how many data points do you want to display for each variable? - Will you display time serious data or among items or groups.</p>
<p>After answered this question, you shoul able to get a better imagenation of your ideal graph. The simple guidance for using different type of chart is line charts for tracking trends over time, bar charts to compare quantities, scatter plots for joint variation of two data items, bubble charts showing joint variation of three data items, and pie charts to compare parts of a whole.</p>
<p>Let’s review the most commonly used chart types and expalin what circumstance should better use typical chart and the pros and conts of each type of chart. Before introduce differnt types of charts, you can use the following website to familiar with different types of charts.</p>
<p><strong>Type 1 Column Charts.</strong> This should be the most popular chart type. This chart is good to do comparison between different values when specific values are important. TBD</p>
<p>Still have hard time to choose? There are many resources on line can help you do the decision. For example, Dr. Andre Abela create a chart selection diagram that is helpful to pick the right chart depends on the data type. The link of website is</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> 7. Guide for Developing Dashboards</h2>
<p>Three rules to follow in order to develop intuitive dashboards:</p>
<pre><code>1. the dashboard should read left to right
2. group related information together
3. find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.</code></pre>
<p>Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead to effective presentation of the data.</p>
<p>Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader’s eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important. Annual data is usually more important to a business but daily or weekly data could be used more often for day to day work. This should be kept in mind when designing a dashboard as dashboards are often used as a quick convenient way to look up data.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.10.1</span> Misleading Graphs</h3>
<p>Misleading graphs or distorted graphs, are graphs created which skews the data, intentionally or unintentionally, resulting in a representation of incorrect conclusions.</p>
<p>There are some ways in which distorted graphs can be created:</p>
<p><strong>1. Improper scaling of y axis:</strong><br />
This is one of the classic misleading graphs. Instead of scale starting from zero or a baseline, y axis is scaled conveniently to highlight the differences among bins.</p>
<p><strong>2. Improper labelling of graphs:</strong><br />
Lack of labels make the graph hard to interpret for the reader and lead to wrong conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Paired graphs on different scale:</strong><br />
It is not a fair comparison if two elements are plotted side-by-side, on a different scale and compared. This makes one graph look better than the other, even when it is not.</p>
<p><strong>4. Dual axis with different scales:</strong><br />
If we are plotting two elements on the same graph with different scales, even if the axes are properly labeled, it is assumed that both axes are on the same scale.</p>
<p>**5. Incomplete <a href="data:**" class="uri">data:**</a><br />
Short-term graphs are made to manipulate the trend, which will not be seen otherwise. Time-series data are cut intentionally to just show a trend within a particular period to create a more favorable visual impression.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.10.2</span> Current Research: Deceptive Disualizations</h3>
<p>Data visualization is a powerful communication tool to support arguments with numbers in a way that is accessible and engaging. More people than ever before are making their own charts and infographics, which is presenting a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading or downright deceptive data visualizations. Here are additional references on this topic: <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="decept_study"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rose_tint"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong> <span class="citation">(Bishop <a href="#ref-visual-lies">2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>The article focuses on a few methods that data visualizers utilize to mislead users about research findings. For each method, the author has highlighted the signifiers that are manipulated to promote an unrealistic understanding of the visualized data. The author has concentrated on examples of three areas to create deceptive data visualization: size, segmentation, and graph type.</p>
<p>** Size **<br />
Size signifies quantity, volume or degree of variables within a data. In first figure the y-axis from the graph to the right is cut when transcribed onto the graph on the left. Here both the graphs show the same data but the one on the left represents the data in a misleading fashion because of the way the axis is cut, and the result is that interest rates have increased drastically from 2008 to 2012 – a misinterpretation that is avoided in the graph on the right.</p>
<p>Figure 1:<br />
<img src="images/Size1.png" /></p>
<p>Quantity is the measure of size. When depicting points on a scatter plot, the author suggest that it is helpful to manipulate the size the points to represent differing values of a variable that is not represented on the x and y axes. Following graph shows quantity as a two completely different measure. One chart uses quantity as Area and other uses it as radius. The result is that the differences in quantity between points on such a scatter plot would appear more dramatic than they should be.</p>
<p>Figure 2:<br />
<img src="images/Quantity1.png" /></p>
<p>** Segmentation **<br />
Figure shows an example of this with a deceptive instance of binning given in the legend on the left. Segmentation can be used to show category, parts, domains or ranges within a chart. The author states that correct use of segmentation can enable users to enhance understanding and if used incorrectly can be deceptive. It is shown here binning is different in both and since in the left figure binning is not done appropriately it is difficult to come up with actual values of the data.</p>
<p>Figure 3:<br />
<img src="images/Segmentation%201.png" /></p>
<p>** Graph **<br />
Two graphs that are most often misrepresented are pie-charts and maps. The author explains that in the following figure Pie charts can’t be compared accurately to one another. When striving for an accurate portrayal of values, they should be avoided. The author further states that it would be difficult to understand the pie-charts had the numbers weren’t given.</p>
<p>Figure 4:<br />
<img src="images/PieCharts.png" /></p>
<p>The author then states that when showing spatial data analysis always show population density when visualizing values that are person-dependent. On a heat map where color signifies quantity, The author suggests that a user will be drawn to the colors that a legend indicates are most extreme.</p>
<p>In following figure, areas that are darkest are simply the most population-dense regions of the United States. Without accounting for population density, the newly created map may look the same as hundreds of maps bearing a striking resemblance to the figure, which are falsely considered informative and are regularly shared across social media sites.</p>
<p>Figure 5:<br />
<img src="images/Maps1.png" /></p>
<p>The above pointers are very helpful when creating a deceptive version of a data product. However, as data visualizers we carefully need to draw the line between creating misleading graphs that tells a different story and deceptive version which is meant for exaggeration. The above can be applied in our projects and can also be used to enhance our understanding of great data visualization product.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.10.3</span> Typography and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>This article discusses less common applications of typography in data visualization. While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, and other typographic elements in data visualization are less prevalent.</p>
<p>Highlighted in the article are preattentive visual attributes; preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of how many items are displayed. Therefore, “preattentive visual attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and are virtually unaffected by load.” Examples of preattentive attributes are size/area, hue, and curvature.</p>
<p>This brings us to the disparateness of the popularity of visual aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual attributes like size and hue.However, some typographic attributes such as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the two) are considered preattentive as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data visualizations by technological advances.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general, the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small group of people rather than all of the data visualization design community. I would say that it is more likely that the use of typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias—if current visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken. However, the authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization, other spheres like typography, cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming “have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space.”</p>
<p>The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and blocks of words.Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.11</span> 9. Contemporary Research Results &amp; What’s Next</h2>
<p>Next Steps for Data Visualization Research</p>
<p>With the development, studies and new tools applied in data visualization, more people understand it matters. But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new approaches:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Adapting the Publication and Review Process As the article states, “both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reviews could serve as valuable guides”, so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for fledgling practitioners in the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting Discussion and Accretion Discussion of research papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the online forum.</p></li>
<li><p>Research Methods Training Developing a core curriculum for data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS faculty organized a new course on Designing Computer Science Experiments. Also, online resources could be reinforced with a catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided study to online courses. Useful examples include Jake Wobbrock’s Practical Statistics for HCI and Pierre Dragicevic’s resources for reforming statistical practice.</p></li>

<p>There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for data visualization in the article, not all of which I agree are made more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes, but the “Who Survived the Titanic�? visualization’s use of typographic attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly, such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text replacement to indicate gender and the passengers�? names.</p>

<p>The authors round out the article by addressing the most common criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being whether or not text should even be considered an element of data visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more investment of attention to understand. Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that “this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type,�? that while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of higher level patterns. Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying lengths representations of passengers�? names, and was corrected by only including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only vary so much.</p>

This gives a thorough understanding of when to use which type of visualization. Once we visualize the data we need to ask the following questions:</p>
<p>1 What can I see in this image? Is it what I expected? 2 Are there any interesting patterns? 3 What does this mean in the context of the data?</p>
<p>The basic question answer format gives an idea to the viewers about what kind of perspectives can we look at the data. Sometimes we discover something and sometimes we don’t. But the author mentions that we always learn something from the visualization. Once we document the data insights based on the above question we need to have the following points into consideration:</p>
<p>1 Why have I created this chart? 2 What have I done to the data to create it? 3 What does this chart tell me? Each stage is explained in-depth further. Data Visualization can be done in many ways such as tables which are great for one dimensional data however they are bad for multi-dimensional data.

<p>The above question answer format compels the viewers to think deeper about what exactly we are trying to find. Because many times the viewers are simply too overwhelmed with the size of data that they lose the basic idea. Hence this kind of approach help to stay focused. The author then mentions that based on the above insights we might have some idea about some interesting patterns. Since we already have an idea we might want to see it in more detail and hence we transform data in more details such as Zooming, Filtering, Outlier Removal. The author then explains how transformed data can help us to see a more detailed view of our insights.</p>
<p>Further the author gives a detailed explanation of which data visualization tool to use based on the situation. The entire process given above is explained in depth with the help of examples. The technical approach listed above is practical and can be implemented easily on our data visualization projects. I liked the author’s approach because he has cleverly integrated the step-by-step process of finding insights with the technical way of handling datasets using tools such as Tableau, Python, etc. And the process can be repeated many times till we find the insights we are looking for.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.14.1</span> Contemporary Research Results &amp; What’s Next</h3>
<p>Next Steps for Data Visualization Research:</p>
<p>With the development, studies and new tools applied in data visualization, more people understand it matters. But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new approaches:</p>
<p><strong>1. Adapting the Publication and Review Process</strong><br />
As the article states, “both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reviews could serve as valuable guides”, so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for fledgling practitioners in the field.</p>
<p><strong>2. Promoting Discussion and Accretion</strong><br />
Discussion of research papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the online forum.</p>
<p><strong>3. Research Methods Training</strong><br />
Developing a core curriculum for data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS faculty organized a new course on Designing Computer Science Experiments(<a href="http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/" class="uri">http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/</a>). Also, online resources could be reinforced with a catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided study to online courses. Useful examples include Jake Wobbrock’s Practical Statistics for HCI and Pierre Dragicevic’s resources for reforming statistical practice.</p>

<p><strong>Some best practices for visualization:</strong><br />
<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="DataVizBestPrac"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>Here is free pdf to some best practices in visual analysis. It talks about the right charts to be used for various kinds of analysis. It is very relevant for data science students as we would be interested in presenting our analysis using simple and effective visualizations that tell the complete story.</p>
<p>Some of key areas for which the author highlights some best practices are for visualizing trends over time, comparison and ranking, correlation, distribution, geographical data etc.</p>
<p>The author gives examples on how simple graphs can also become more effective by just adding a few more elements or some simple adjustments.</p>
<p>I feel this is a great starting point to create effective charts and we may use these principles also when we start doing advanced analytics.</p>

<p>This article explains how time series data visualization can sometimes be deceptive.It first takes an example of two random time series data and plots them on a graph which gives an impression that the two are strongly correlated. But if we do some statistical testing the two do not show any relationship, this is an example of “correlation does not necessary mean causation”.In another set of examples author has taken trending two random time series data and shown how even statistical tests can give a wrong interpretation. The article then explains using visualization how a general trended time series can be different than a more controlled and measured trending time series.</p>

<p>Corporate transparency, flat organizations, open book policies, etc. are terms executives and entrepreneurs learn about all the time. As the corporate world shifts towards a more open culture, the demand for open data and insights have increased dramatically. This shift has helped the overall corporate strategic planning and management process–easing the alignment of business activities towards a series of goals. Being transparent top down aligns the culture to sail towards the same North Star.</p>
<p>The growth of corporate transparency is not only important internally, but externally as well. Corporate certifications like B Corporations certifications (B Corp), require companies to provide a transparent view on their social conscious efforts to the general public. Achieving the certification is one step of the process; the true goal is to show the world how and why the certification is truly deserved.</p>
<p>How does data visualization play a part? Data Visualization helps reveal insights and patterns that aren’t immediately visible in the raw data. Here’s the process on how to get it done:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Perform Data Discovery and Determine The Story</strong><br />
Before this step it is easy to underestimate the effort level it takes to pull the best insights from the data. Data manipulation products like Tableau, Domo, Pentaho, IBM’s Many Eyes, and R, among others, make insight extraction that much easier to gain understanding of data using a visual medium.</p>
<p>The key is to start with a simple portion of your data and to start pulling basic insights to visualize and correlate with each other. This process leads towards a compound series of questions, which helps provide an overall vision to the end product. We see the effect during our discovery process, which leads to unforeseen avenues for data intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Data Infrastructure Setup</strong><br />
Data infrastructures can be simple or complex depending what the end goal is. Many clients prefer to go the route of complete data integration in order to centralize their data repositories. Technologies such as Hadoop have helped by unifying disparate data sources, but other options such as data cloud environments can help produce API’s for future product deployments. Why is this important? Accessibility of data is an important foundation not only within the context of dashboards, but also the possibility of branching out to other products.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Product Design &amp; Development</strong><br />
Wireframing, prototyping, and application development are the main engines to transform an idea into a final product. Products can range from static presentations/reports to full interactive applications. Mobile, tablet, TV, and workstation platforms can all be mediums to help deliver the final product. The secret to a great end product is how well the data story is conceptualized. If the story is weak then the end product will also suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: QA &amp; Product Release</strong><br />
The best part of any project is to get it finalized and released for all to see. All data gets verified for accuracy, functionality testing (if applicable), application flow (if applicable), design testing, and remaining items are all completed. The end result is an engaging visual product for all intended audiences to see and use.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.14.3</span> Data Visualization Tools</h3>
<p>Lisa Rost’s article “What I learned recreating one chart using 24 tools” describes lessons learned from recreating one chart using many different data visualization tools.The author used apps Excel, Plotly, Easycharts, Google Sheets, Lyra, Highcharts, Tableau, Polestar, Quadrigram, Illustrator, RAW, and NodeBox, as well as charting libraries ggvis, Bokeh, Highcharts, ggplot2, Processing, NVD3, Seaborn, Vega, D3, matplotlib, Vega-Lite, and R.She links her github page on the project which details the dataset she used, containing the health expectancy in years as well as GDP per capita and population for about 200 countries in the year 2015, as well has her process and results of visualizing the data using each tool.However, in the article, she focuses on the main takeaways from the exercise, which was especially interesting in the context of our class discussion on different types of tools and their respective strengths.She also provides her own graphics to help illustrate her lessons learned.</p>
<p>Rost’s first takeaway: <strong>“There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Goals”</strong></p>
<p>Since data visualization is necessary in many spheres, from science to journalism, data visualization projects will often have quite disparate objectives, and the people working on them will have different requirements.And as the author aptly points out, it is impossible for one tool to satisfy the needs of every data visualizer; so there will necessarily be tools better suited to specific situations.</p>
<p>For example, does the user need a tool for exploratory visualization of the data, or does the user seek to create graphs and charts to show the public or a specific audience something?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/analysis_spectrum.png" />

</div>
<p>The author also notes that the flexibility of a tool is a sticking point as well—if you need to change your data while developing a data visualization, certain apps like Illustrator will not be ideal because changing the data even slightly requires you to build the graph again from scratch. Another thing to think about is the type of chart you are trying to create—is a basic, canned bar or line graph all you need (in which case something like Excel will do the trick), or does your project necessitate a more innovative or custom chart (like something possible in D3.js)? Interactivity is another big question—only certain tools will make this possible.</p>
<p>Rost’s next takeaway: <strong>“There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Mindsets”</strong></p>
<p>This section of the article is all about the difference in people’s preferences and opinions; from the people who build the tools to the users, everyone thinks differently.Therefore, certain tools will be inherently more intuitive to use for different people.</p>
<p>Rost’s third lesson: <strong>“ We Still Live in an ‘Apps Are for the Easy Stuff, Code Is for the Good Stuff’ World”</strong></p>
<p>Basically, writing code can be scary for anyone without a coding background, but it provides more flexibility, and, as mentioned in class, code is perfectly reproducible.On the other hand, apps are much more user-friendly for the less computer science-savvy.</p>
<p>Rost’s final lesson: <strong>“‘Every Tool Forces You Down a Path’”</strong></p>
<p>The above question answer format compels the viewers to think deeper about what exactly we are trying to find. Because many times the viewers are simply too overwhelmed with the size of data that they lose the basic idea. Hence this kind of approach help to stay focused. The author then mentions that based on the above insights we might have some idea about some interesting patterns. Since we already have an idea we might want to see it in more detail and hence we transform data in more details such as Zooming, Filtering, Outlier Removal. The author then explains how transformed data can help us to see a more detailed view of our insights.</p>
<p>Further the author gives a detailed explanation of which data visualization tool to use based on the situation. The entire process given above is explained in depth with the help of examples. The technical approach listed above is practical and can be implemented easily on our data visualization projects. I liked the author’s approach because he has cleverly integrated the step-by-step process of finding insights with the technical way of handling datasets using tools such as Tableau, Python, etc. And the process can be repeated many times till we find the insights we are looking for.</p>

<p><strong>There are multiple ways by which interactive data visualizations can be developed:</strong></p>
<p><strong>D3.js:</strong><br />
Visualize the Big Data in literally any way you need.</p>
<p>D3.js stands for Data Driven Document, a JS library for interactive Big Data visualization in literally ANY way required real-time. This is not a tool, mind you, so a user should have a solid understanding of Javascript to work with the data and present it in a humanly-understandable form. To say more, this library renders the data into SVG and HTML5 formats, so older browsers like IE7 and 8 cannot leverage D3.js capabilities.</p>
<p>The data gathered from disparate sources like huge-scale data sets is binded in real-time with DOMto produce interactive animations ( 2D and 3D alike) in an extremely rapid way. The D3 architecture allows the users to intensively reuse the codes across a variety of add-ons and plug-ins. 1. Absorb information in constructive ways: With the volume and velocity of data created everyday, dynamic data viz enables enhanced process optimization, insight discovery and decision making. 2.

<p>13.2 D3.js:</p>
<p>D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers(From Wikipedia). It is highly functional, meaning you can reuse the code and add functions relevant to your project. Embedded within an HTML webpage, the JavaScript D3.js library uses pre-built JavaScript functions to select elements, create SVG objects, style them, or add transitions, dynamic effects or tooltips to them.</p>
<p>Some of the key advantages are: It is dynamic, free and open source and very flexible with all web technologies, the abiity to handle big data and the functional style allows to reuse the codes.</p>

<p><strong>R Shiny :</strong> 13.4 R Shiny :</p>
<p>R Shiny enables us to produce interactive data visualizations with a minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Java using a simple web application framework that runs under the R statistical platform. Standalone apps can be hosted on a webpage or embedded in R Markdown documents and dashboards can be built using R shiny. It combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web.</p>
<p>The main advantages of using R Shiny are : Its flexibility of pulling in whatever package in R that you want to solve your problem, reaping the benefits of an open source ecosystem for R and Javascript visualization libraries, thereby allowing to create highly custom applications and enabling timely, high quality interactive data experience without (or with much less) web development and without the limitations or cost of proprietary BI tools.</p>

There is a lot to learn besides the d3.js API, both technical knowledge around web standards like HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript as well as communication concepts and data visualization principles. Chances are you know something about some of those things, so this guide will attempt to give you good starting points for the things you want to learn more about.</p>
<p>It starts from the insights of learning d3.js by showing interviews with those top visualization practitioners. Then the author gives key concepts and useful features for learning visualization like d3-shape, d3 selection, d3-collection, ds-hierarchy, ds-zoom as well as d3-force.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this guide is it lists a lot of useful resources links for learning d3.js. For example, it recommends d3 API Reference, 2000+ d3 case studies and tutorials for d3. I did my exploratory analysis version of group project on d3. And I found this guide helpful during the progress. It also includes some meetup groups here in the bay area. So, maybe we can meet data friends through the group.</p>
<p>This article explains how time series data visualization can sometimes be deceptive. It first takes an example of two random time series data and plots them on a graph which gives an impression that the two are strongly correlated. But if we do some statistical testing the two do not show any relationship, this is an example of “correlation does not necessary mean causation”. In another set of examples author has taken trending two random time series data and shown how even statistical tests can give a wrong interpretation. The article then explains using visualization how a general trended time series can be different than a more controlled and measured trending time series.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.18</span> 15. Corporate Scorecards and Data Visualization</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(Boost Labs <a href="#ref-SCORECARDS">2015</a>)</span></p>
<p>Corporate transparency, flat organizations, open book policies, etc. are terms executives and entrepreneurs learn about all the time. As the corporate world shifts towards a more open culture, the demand for open data and insights have increased dramatically. This shift has helped the overall corporate strategic planning and management process–easing the alignment of business activities towards a series of goals. Being transparent top down aligns the culture to sail towards the same North Star.</p>
<p>The growth of corporate transparency is not only important internally, but externally as well. Corporate certifications like B Corporations certifications (B Corp), require companies to provide a transparent view on their social conscious efforts to the general public. Achieving the certification is one step of the process; the true goal is to show the world how and why the certification is truly deserved.</p>
<p><strong>Story Telling with Data</strong></p>
<p>Story telling is an essential part of data visualization. It is extremely important to effectively communicate information through the visualization. Stikeleather (2013)’s article talked about how a visual designer tells a story with a visualization. Mainly there are five strategies that can be applied during visualization:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the compelling narrative.<br />
</li>
<li>Think about the audience (e.g., novice, generalist, managerial, export, exectitve)<br />
</li>
<li>Be objective and offer balance<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t censor<br />
</li>
<li>Finally, Edit, Edit, Edit.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does data visualization play a part? Data Visualization helps reveal insights and patterns that aren’t immediately visible in the raw data. Here’s the process on how to get it done:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Perform Data Discovery and Determine The Story</strong> Before this step it is easy to underestimate the effort level it takes to pull the best insights from the data. Data manipulation products like Tableau, Domo, Pentaho, IBM’s Many Eyes, and R, among others, make insight extraction that much easier to gain understanding of data using a visual medium.</p>
<p>The key is to start with a simple portion of your data and to start pulling basic insights to visualize and correlate with each other. This process leads towards a compound series of questions, which helps provide an overall vision to the end product. We see the effect during our discovery process, which leads to unforeseen avenues for data intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Data Infrastructure Setup</strong> Data infrastructures can be simple or complex depending what the end goal is. Many clients prefer to go the route of complete data integration in order to centralize their data repositories. Technologies such as Hadoop have helped by unifying disparate data sources, but other options such as data cloud environments can help produce API’s for future product deployments. Why is this important? Accessibility of data is an important foundation not only within the context of dashboards, but also the possibility of branching out to other products.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Product Design &amp; Development</strong> Wireframing, prototyping, and application development are the main engines to transform an idea into a final product. Products can range from static presentations/reports to full interactive applications. Mobile, tablet, TV, and workstation platforms can all be mediums to help deliver the final product. The secret to a great end product is how well the data story is conceptualized. If the story is weak then the end product will also suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: QA &amp; Product Release</strong> The best part of any project is to get it finalized and released for all to see. All data gets verified for accuracy, functionality testing (if applicable), application flow (if applicable), design testing, and remaining items are all completed. The end result is an engaging visual product for all intended audiences to see and use.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.19</span> 16 Visual Lies: Usability in Deceptive Data Visualizations</h2>
<p>Reference - <span class="citation">(Bishop <a href="#ref-visual-lies">2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>The article focuses on a few methods that data visualizers utilize to mislead users about research findings. For each method, the author has highlighted the signifiers that are manipulated to promote an unrealistic understanding of the visualized data. The author has concentrated on examples of three areas to create deceptive data visualization: size, segmentation, and graph type.</p>
<p>** Size ** Size signifies quantity, volume or degree of variables within a data. In first figure the y-axis from the graph to the right is cut when transcribed onto the graph on the left. Here both the graphs show the same data but the one on the left represents the data in a misleading fashion because of the way the axis is cut, and the result is that interest rates have increased drastically from 2008 to 2012 – a misinterpretation that is avoided in the graph on the right.</p>
<p>Figure 1: <img src="images/Size1.png" /></p>
<p>The tool is rendering the resulting charts to HTML5/SVG, so they are compatible with any browser. Support for VML ensures compatibility with older IE versions, and the charts can be ported to the latest releases of Android and iOS. What’s even more important, Google chart combines the data from multiple Google services like Google Maps. This results in producing interactive charts that absorb data real-time and can be controlled using an interactive dashboard.<br />
[<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-4-popular-big-data-visualization-tools-4ee945fe207d" class="uri">https://towardsdatascience.com/top-4-popular-big-data-visualization-tools-4ee945fe207d</a>] Quantity is the measure of size. When depicting points on a scatter plot, the author suggest that it is helpful to manipulate the size the points to represent differing values of a variable that is not represented on the x and y axes. Following graph shows quantity as a two completely different measure. One chart uses quantity as Area and other uses it as radius. The result is that the differences in quantity between points on such a scatter plot would appear more dramatic than they should be.</p>

<p>** Segmentation **<br />
Figure shows an example of this with a deceptive instance of binning given in the legend on the left. Segmentation can be used to show category, parts, domains or ranges within a chart. The author states that correct use of segmentation can enable users to enhance understanding and if used incorrectly can be deceptive. It is shown here binning is different in both and since in the left figure binning is not done appropriately it is difficult to come up with actual values of the data. <img src="images/Quantity1.png" /> ``</p>

<p>** Graph **<br />
Two graphs that are most often misrepresented are pie-charts and maps. The author explains that in the following figure Pie charts can’t be compared accurately to one another. When striving for an accurate portrayal of values, they should be avoided. The author further states that it would be difficult to understand the pie-charts had the numbers weren’t given.</p>
<p>Figure 4: <img src="images/PieCharts.png" /></p>
<p>The author then states that when showing spatial data analysis always show population density when visualizing values that are person-dependent. On a heat map where color signifies quantity, The author suggests that a user will be drawn to the colors that a legend indicates are most extreme.</p>
<p>In following figure, areas that are darkest are simply the most population-dense regions of the United States. Without accounting for population density, the newly created map may look the same as hundreds of maps bearing a striking resemblance to the figure, which are falsely considered informative and are regularly shared across social media sites.</p>
<p>Figure 5:</p>
<p>The above pointers are very helpful when creating a deceptive version of a data product. However, as data visualizers we carefully need to draw the line between creating misleading graphs that tells a different story and deceptive version which is meant for exaggeration. The above can be applied in our projects and can also be used to enhance our understanding of great data visualization product.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.20</span> 17. Guide to Best Practices in Data Visualization</h2>
<p><a href="http://paristech.com/blog/data-visualization-best-practices/" class="uri">http://paristech.com/blog/data-visualization-best-practices/</a><br />
<a href="http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/announcing-the-slide-chooser.html" class="uri">http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/announcing-the-slide-chooser.html</a></p>
<p>A graph should be impressive and can obtain audience’s attention. How can we achieve this? We must consider several aspects: <strong>efficiency, complexity, structure, density and beauty</strong>. We also should consider the audience whether they will be confused about the design.</p>
<p><strong>• Design principle of graphical excellence</strong><br />
Statistical graphics are kind of graphics we use a lot for data analysis so I want to summarize some principles mentioned in this Tufte’s great book.Here we must follow some principles for statistical graphics:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within reason.</strong></p>
<p>Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant inkarranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.</p>
<p>Data-ink ratio = data-ink/total ink used to print the graphic = proportion of graphic’s ink devoted to the non-redundant display of data-information</p>
<p>This basic principle follows by two principles:<br />
1. Erase non-data-ink, within reason.<br />
2. Erase redundant data-ink, within reason.<br />
3. always revise and edit.</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
<strong>1.Erase non-data-ink and redundant data-ink.</strong><br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure1.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>2. Erase non-data-ink and redundant data-ink.</strong><br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure2.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Plotly <a href="#ref-appli_2017">2017</a>)</span>)</p>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure3.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Plotly <a href="#ref-appli_2017">2017</a>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>3. always revise and edit.</strong><br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure4.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
1. The graphs will be better for more information per unit of space an d per unit of ink is displayed.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Graphics are almost always going to improve as they go through editing ,revision, and testing against differernt design options.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to figure out whehter the audience looking at the new designs be confused? Nothing is lost to those puzzled by the frame of dashes,and something is gained by those who do understand. We can also assume that if you understand the statistical graphics, most other readers will, too because it is a frequent mistake in thinking about statistical graphics to underestimate the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the new designs may appear odd, but this is probably because we have not seen them before.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data.</strong></p>
<p>The danger of multifunctioning elements is that they tend to generate graphical puzzles, with encodings that can only be broken by their inventor.Thus design techniques for enhancing graphical clarity in the face of complexity must be developed along with multifunctioning elements.</p>
<p>In other words, we should try to make all present graphical elements data encoding elements.We must make every graphical element effective.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure6.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: maximize data density and the size of the data matrix, within reason.</strong></p>
<p>High performation graphics should be design with special care. As volume of data increases, data measures must shrink (smaller dots ofr scatters,thinner lines for busy time-series). <span class="citation">(J.Camm and Shaffer <a href="#ref-best-practice">2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>Data Density = # entries in data matrix /area of data graphic</p>
<p><strong>• Conclusion: composition of design principles</strong></p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Escape flatland – small multiples, parallel sequencing.</strong></p>
<p>Data is multivariate. Doesn’t necessarily mean 3D projection. How can we enhance mulitvariate data on inherently 2D surfaces?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Example for small multiples.<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure8.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Example for parallel sequencing<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure7.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Macro/Micro-Provide the user with both views (overview and detail).</strong></p>
<p>Carefully designed view can show a macro structure (overview) as well as micro structure (detail) in one space.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure9.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Utilize Layering &amp; Separation.</strong></p>
<p>Supported by Gestalt laws (The principles of grouping):<br />
1. Grouping with colors<br />
2. Using Color to separate<br />
3. 1+1 = 3 (clutter)</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure10.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4: Utilize narratives of space and time.</strong></p>
<p>Tell a story of position and chronology through visual elements.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure11.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Periscope <a href="#ref-narratives_2017">2018</a>)</span>)<br />

<p>We want visualizations to speak about the data. This article is about some tips that can help visualizations to speak:</p>
<p>Keep it simple:Keep charts simple and easy to interpret. Instead of overloading peoples brain with lots of information, keep only the necessary things in the chart and help the audience understand quickly what’s going on.</p>
<p>Pretty doesn’t mean effective: There is a misconception that aesthetically pleasing visualization is more effective.To draw attention, sometimes we want them to be pretty and eye-catching. But if it fails to communicate that data properly, then you’ll lose people’s interest as quickly as you gained it.</p>
<p>Color for Numerical Scales: Color for numerical scales should be used with caution.The way you interpret a shade depends on the colors around it and sometimes it can lead to false conclusions.For data with geographical fields, it may be tempting to use maps. But maps may not be very effective for the following reasons:</p>
<p>As mentioned above, color perception can be tricky.</p>
<p>Choosing the right charts type is very critical. For comparison based on numerical scale bar chart can be more effective than maps.</p>
<p>Leverage Color Associations: When we say strawberries we associate red color with it. If we can leverage the how people associate different colors for different things, we will not even need legend to interpret things. Color can be used to leverage long-term memory very quickly.</p>
<p>Use Bright Colors to Highlight: To attract attention to a certain part of data, bright colors can be used. Alarm colors draw the eye quickly to areas that need attention and help get that message across.</p>
<p>Maps: Use of maps can be tricky. Geographical data doesn’t imply a map. Maps can be useful for application where proximity matters they can be great for applications where proximity matters, but for straight “what is higher” type comparisons, they’re not very effective as large regions will draw attention easier than smaller regions due to more concentrated color.</p>
<p>5 Second Rule: Research shows that on average modern attention span for looking at things online is less than 5 seconds. So if you can’t grab attention within 5 minutes, you’ve likely lost your viewer</p>
<p>Includes clear titles and instructions and tell people succinctly what the visualization shows and how to interact with it.</p>
<p>These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and then focus your visualization with respect to those questions.</p>
<p>Brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways – unconscious (System 1 represents uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 – represents controlled function such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System -1 which has can have quick and correct impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows: -</p>
<p>** 1. Design and layout matter <strong> The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer. </strong> 2. Avoid Clutter <strong> Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio – the ratio of ink required to convey the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That means, avoid ink which do not add any information. </strong> 3. Use color purposely and effectively ** Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists in conveying your message. The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above principles.And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.21</span> Gestalt Principles for Data Viz</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(FusionCharts <a href="#ref-principles-fusioncharts">2012</a>)</span></p>
<p>This is a pretty detailed white paper PDF from FusionCharts that explores key aspects of effective data visualization in the business world, from goals to preattentive attributes to applying Gestalt Principles. Because some of the aspects such as using color and design effectively have been covered earlier on in the Fundamentals section, this summary will mainly focus on the Gestalt Principles.</p>
<p>Data is simply a collection of many individual elements (ie, observations, typically represented as rows in a data table). In data viz, our goal is usually to group these elements together in a meaningful way to highlight patterns and anomalies. Described this way, it makes sense that Gestalt Principles are a good set of guidelines for data viz, because these principles describe how we assemble different elements into groups.</p>
<p><strong>Gestalt Principles include the following:</strong> 1. Proximity - white space can be used to group elements together and separate others 2. Similarity - objects that look similar are instinctively grouped together in our minds 3. Enclosure - helps distinguish between groups 4. Symmetry 5. Closure - we tend to complete shapes and paths even if part of them is missing 6. Continuity - similar to closure 7. Connection - helps group elements together as well 8. Figure and ground - we typically notice only one of several main visual aspects of a graph; what we do notice becomes the figure, and everything else becomes the “background”. This one is especially interesting because it is not as obvious as some of the others, but is really important in matching a data viz design to its purpose.</p>
<p>Examples of each of the above are presented on page 11 of the PDF.</p>
<p>The principles are quite theoretical and in practice, preattentive attributes such as spatial position, size, and color are means of applying the principles.</p>
