<p>“The only new thing in the world is the history you don’t know.” — Harry S Truman</p>

<p>This paper provides an overview of the intellectual history of data visualization from medieval to modern times, it describes and illustrates some significant advances along the way. It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots.These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields. Developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="data_viz_history"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>

<div id="three-rules-to-follow-in-order-to-develop-intuitive-dashboards" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Three Rules to Follow in order to Develop Intuitive Dashboards:</h3>
<p>Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead to effective presentation of the data <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="intuitive-dash"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>1. The dashboard should read left to right</strong> Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader’s eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important. Annual data is usually more important to a business but daily or weekly data could be used more often for day to day work. This should be kept in mind when designing a dashboard as dashboards are often used as a quick convenient way to look up data.</p>
<p><strong>2. Group related information together</strong> Grouping related data together is an intuitive way to help the flow of the visual. It does not make sense for a user to have to search in different areas to find the information they need.</p>
<p><strong>3. Find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.</strong> Grouping unrelated data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the important thing is to tell a story not previously observed. Data analytics is all about finding stories the data are trying to tell. Once they are discovered, the stories need to be presented in an effective manner. Grouping unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they change together.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Fundamental Components of Design</h2>
<p>Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity as the design foundation of any work. If you want to take your data visualization from an everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the following nine principles of design from graphic designer Melissa Anderson <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="design_principles"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>

<td>Balance</td>
<td>A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color, shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Emphasis</td>
<td>Draw viewers attention towards important data by using key visual elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Movement</td>
<td>Ideally movement should mimic the way people usually read, starting at the top of the page, moving across it, and then down. Movement can also be created by using complimentary colors to pull the user’s attention across the page.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Pattern</td>
<td>patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or for sets of data that equal in value. Disrupting the pattern can also be effective in drawing viewers attention; it naturally draws curiosity.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Repetition</td>
<td>Relationships between sets of data can be communicated by repeating chart types, shapes, or colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Proportion</td>
<td>If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going look bigger. In data visualization, proportion can indicate the importance of data sets, along with the actual relationship between numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Rhythm</td>
<td>A design has proper rhythm when the design elements create movement that is pleasing to the eye. If the design is not able to do so, rearranging visual elements may help.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Variety</td>
<td>Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be overlooked.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Unity</td>
<td>Unity across design will happen naturally if all other design principles are implemented.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualization distributed evenly. And it is important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc. that can affect the balance of the display. Another closely related component to balance is variety, which could seem counter to balance, but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer. Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer’s experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization. Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through the nine principles of design in this article. From prior experience with art through photography, I understand it is the key to be conscious of what I am drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</p>
<div id="visualization-and-graphics-principles-to-refocus-and-guide-you" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Visualization and Graphics Principles to Refocus and Guide You</h3>
<p>Jonathon Corum is a graphics designer for The New York Times and he provided a very informative talk to a strictly scientific audience on how to create and design visualizations that explain material originally created for a certain audience, i.e. the scientific community, but now is to be related to a different audience, (in his case, the readership of the Times or maybe the public at large). The talk is filled with examples and break downs of how he has moved from his base content to the final product, all of which are illuminating examples by themselves. There is also great power in the broader themes that he is trying to convey.</p>
<p>First, of course is knowing the audience that you are producing the work for, but even in this step, do not lose sight of the ultimate goal of conveying understanding, of explaining a concept. You are searching for a visual idea in your content that can be communicated to your audience. Some of the main highlights to help you make this connection with your audience involve:</p>
<p><strong>Focusing the attention:</strong> What can be removed? Realize that consistency can help eliminate unnecessary distractions. There may be a trade off between losing information but conveying the ultimate meaning more clearly. Label important things rather than relying on a legend, which requires the viewer to hold on to too much information at once.</p>
<p><strong>Involving your audience:</strong> Give them opportunities to connect their own general knowledge on the topic. Use real world comparisons or examples to help build and relate context. Encourage comparisons and make this easy for the viewer to process and see.</p>
<p><strong>Explaining why:</strong> Providing context, adding time sequence details, showing movement, change and mechanism will all guide your audience in connecting the dots and understanding the significance of what you are trying to communicate.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Data Visualization Tools</h2>
<p>Due to the rise of big data analytics, there has been an increased need for data visualization tools to help understand the data. Besides Tableau, there are several other software tools one can use for data visualization like Sisense, Plotly, FusionCharts, Highcharts, Datawrapper, and Qlikview. This article is from Forbes and has a brief, clear introduction about these 7 powerful software options for data visualization. This could be helpful for future reference because for different purposes I may need to use different tools.

<div id="what-i-learned-recreating-one-chart-using-24-tools" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> What I learned recreating one chart using 24 tools</h2>
<p>Lisa Rost’s article “What I learned recreating one chart using 24 tools” describes lessons learned from recreating one chart using many different data visualization tools <span class="citation">(Rost <a href="#ref-different_tools">2016</a>)</span>. The author used apps Excel, Plotly, Easycharts, Google Sheets, Lyra, Highcharts, Tableau, Polestar, Quadrigram, Illustrator, RAW, and NodeBox, as well as charting libraries ggvis, Bokeh, Highcharts, ggplot2, Processing, NVD3, Seaborn, Vega, D3, matplotlib, Vega-Lite, and R. She links her github page on the project which details the data set she used, containing the health expectancy in years as well as GDP per capita and population for about 200 countries in the year 2015, as well has her process and results of visualizing the data using each tool. However, in the article, she focuses on the main takeaways from the exercise, which was especially interesting in the context of our class discussion on different types of tools and their respective strengths. She also provides her own graphics to help illustrate her lessons learned.</p>
<p>Takeaway 1: <strong>“There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Goals”</strong> Since data visualization is necessary in many spheres, from science to journalism, data visualization projects will often have quite disparate objectives, and the people working on them will have different requirements. And as the author aptly points out, it is impossible for one tool to satisfy the needs of every data visualizer; so there will necessarily be tools better suited to specific situations. For example, does the user need a tool for exploratory visualization of the data, or does the user seek to create graphs and charts to show the public or a specific audience something?</p>

<p>The author also notes that the flexibility of a tool is a sticking point as well—if you need to change your data while developing a data visualization, certain apps like Illustrator will not be ideal because changing the data even slightly requires you to build the graph again from scratch. Another thing to think about is the type of chart you are trying to create—is a basic, canned bar or line graph all you need (in which case something like Excel will do the trick), or does your project necessitate a more innovative or custom chart (like something possible in D3.js)? Interactivity is another big question—only certain tools will make this possible.</p>

<p>Takeaway 2: <strong>“There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Mindsets”</strong></p>
<p>This section of the article is all about the difference in people’s preferences and opinions; from the people who build the tools to the users, everyone thinks differently. Therefore, certain tools will be inherently more intuitive to use for different people.</p>
<p>Takeaway 3: <strong>“ We Still Live in an ‘Apps Are for the Easy Stuff, Code Is for the Good Stuff in the World”</strong> Basically, writing code can be scary for anyone without a coding background, but it provides more flexibility, and, as mentioned in class, code is perfectly reproducible. On the other hand, apps are much more user-friendly for the less computer science-savvy.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Definions of Data Deception and Graphic Integrity</h3>
<p>Data visualization is becoming more and more popular to communicate and support arguments nowadays. There are lots of great resources online to create and design amazing data products, but at the same time, there are some poorly-designed, misleading deceptive, data visualizations. Data visualization is a powerful communication tool to support arguments with numbers in a way that is accessible and engaging. More people than ever before are making their own charts and infographics, which is presenting a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading or downright deceptive data visualizations <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="decept_study"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rose_tint"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>So what does <strong>data deception</strong> mean? Data deception, defined by School of Law at the New York University, as “a graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message.”</p>
<p>Edward Tufte already introduced the concept of graphical integrity in his book and presented six principles of graphic integrity. Here are the principles from book:</p>
<ul>
<li>The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities measured.</li>
<li>Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.</li>
<li>In time-series displays of money, deﬂated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.</li>
<li>The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.</li>
<li>Show data variation, not design variation.</li>
<li>Graphics must not quote data out of context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deceptive, misleading, or distorted graphs are graphs created which skews the data, intentionally or unintentionally, resulting in a representation of incorrect conclusions.</p>
<p>There are some ways in which distorted graphs can be created <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="evil_axes"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mislead_graph_ex"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="citation">(Bishop <a href="#ref-visual-lies">2017</a>)</span> focuses on a few methods that data visualizers utilize to mislead users about research findings. For each method, the author has highlighted the signifiers that are manipulated to promote an unrealistic understanding of the visualized data. The author has concentrated on examples of three areas to create deceptive data visualization: size, segmentation, and graph type.</p>
<p>** Size ** Size signifies quantity, volume or degree of variables within a data. In first figure the y-axis from the graph to the right is cut when transcribed onto the graph on the left. Here both the graphs show the same data but the one on the left represents the data in a misleading fashion because of the way the axis is cut, and the result is that interest rates have increased drastically from 2008 to 2012 – a misinterpretation that is avoided in the graph on the right.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Size1.png" />

</div>
<p>** Quantity ** Quantity is the measure of size. When depicting points on a scatter plot, the author suggest that it is helpful to manipulate the size the points to represent differing values of a variable that is not represented on the x and y axes. Following graph shows quantity as a two completely different measure. One chart uses quantity as Area and other uses it as radius. The result is that the differences in quantity between points on such a scatter plot would appear more dramatic than they should be.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Quantity1.png" />

</div>
<p>** Segmentation ** Figure shows an example of this with a deceptive instance of binning given in the legend on the left. Segmentation can be used to show category, parts, domains or ranges within a chart. The author states that correct use of segmentation can enable users to enhance understanding and if used incorrectly can be deceptive. It is shown here binning is different in both and since in the left figure binning is not done appropriately it is difficult to come up with actual values of the data.</p>
<p>Figure 3: <img src="images/Segmentation%201.png" /></p>
<p>** Graph ** Two graphs that are most often misrepresented are pie-charts and maps. The author explains that in the following figure Pie charts can’t be compared accurately to one another. When striving for an accurate portrayal of values, they should be avoided. The author further states that it would be difficult to understand the pie-charts had the numbers were not’t given.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/PieCharts.png" />

</div>
<p>The author then states that when showing spatial data analysis always show population density when visualizing values that are person-dependent. On a heat map where color signifies quantity, The author suggests that a user will be drawn to the colors that a legend indicates are most extreme.</p>
<p>In following figure, areas that are darkest are simply the most population-dense regions of the United States. Without accounting for population density, the newly created map may look the same as hundreds of maps bearing a striking resemblance to the figure, which are falsely considered informative and are regularly shared across social media sites.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The above pointers are very helpful when analyzing a deceptive version of a data product. However, as data visualizers we carefully need to draw the line between creating misleading graphs that tells a different story and deceptive version which is meant for exaggeration. The above can be applied in our projects and can also be used to enhance our understanding of great data visualization product.</p>
<p>Misleading graphs are sometimes deliberately misleading and sometimes it’s just a case of people not understanding the data behind the graph they create <span class="citation">(Andalde <a href="#ref-andale_2014">2014</a>)</span>. But some real life misleading graphs go above and beyond the classic types. Some are intended to mislead, others are intended to shock. The “classic” types of misleading graphs include cases where:</p>
<p><strong>The Missing Baseline</strong> For example, the Vertical scale is too big or too small, or skips numbers, or does not’t start at zero, like the graph below: You might be thinking that the graph on the right shows The Times makes double the sales of The Daily Telegraph. But take a closer look at the scale and you’ll see although The Times does make more sales, it’s only beating the competition by about 10%.</p>
<p><strong>The graph isn’t labeled properly.</strong> Graphs can have the correct figures, but still can mislead you. This one used a BIG HEADLINE makes you think that 5.3% of children get spinal cord injuries which is a pretty scary statistic for parents. But the real figure is about .0000003% (based on 2000 injuries per year out of a population of around 74,000,000). And for the figure 1 used in this article: Misleading Graphs: Displaying a Change in One Variable Using Area or Volume <span class="citation">(Robbins <a href="#ref-scaling_issues">2012</a>)</span>, the label for the smaller triangle in this graph says $26.4 while the label for the larger triangle says $114.6. $114.6 is 4.34 times $26.4. It certainly looks to me as if more than 4.34 smaller triangles will fit in the larger triangle. It is the altitudes of the triangles that are proportional to the numbers in the labels.</p>
<p><strong>Data is left out</strong> Only includes part of the data like the following graph which uses temperatures of the first half of the year to prove it was rising dramatically. For more examples and inspirations on misleading graphs or deceptive graphs refer the following articles :</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar charts without zero &amp; evenly spaced tick marks for uneven intervals: <span class="citation">(Robbins <a href="#ref-whats_wrong">2011</a>)</span></li>
<li>Graphs not drawn to scale:<span class="citation">(Robbins <a href="#ref-scaling_issues">2012</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treating correlation as causation.</strong> Even if the labels and data in your graph is correct, it does not mean that the conclusion is logically correct. A correlation between X and Y does not automatically indicate that the change in one variable is caused by the change in the values of the other one, whereas the causation means that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event. From the graph, we should bear in mind that it only presents the correlation between ice cream sold and murders, rather than causation.</p>

</div>
<p>Another trick of misleading graph is axis change: Changing thy y-axis maximum affect how the graph look like. A higher maximum will make the graph to appear less volatile ,less steep than a lower maximum. The other way of axis change is changing the ratio of a graph’s dimensions. This way will affect how the graph appears. We demonstrate changing the ratio of graph dimension for below graphs.</p>

<p>It is not technically wrong but it is definitely misleading.This is often called improper extraction or tactic omitting data, when only a certain chunk of data is included.This is more common in graphs that have time as one of their axis. Here is the graph to show what it is.</p>

</div>
<p>In the data visualization terms, we call it truncated graph. A truncated graph (also known as a torn graph) has a y axis that does not start at 0. These graphs can create the impression of important change where there is relatively little change.Truncated graphs are useful in illustrating small differences.[16] Graphs may also be truncated to save space. Commercial software such as MS Excel will tend to truncate graphs by default if the values are all within a narrow range. Truncating graphs make the readers to change their judgement for something that is not significant looks like a huge difference.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Data Visualization in Business</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(Lazarevich <a href="#ref-biz_strategy">2018</a>)</span> According to an Experian report, 95% of U.S. organizations say that they use data to power business opportunities, and another 84 percent believe data is an integral part of forming a business strategy. Visualization helps data impact business in following ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Cleaning</strong></p>
<p>The simplest way to explain the importance of visualization is to look at visualization as the means to making sense of data. Even the most basic, widely-used data visualization tools that combine simple pie charts and bar graphs help people comprehend large amounts of information fast and easily, compared to paper reports and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare quality assets to derive valuable insights.</p>
<p><strong>2. Extracting</strong></p>
<p>Known versatile tools for data visualization and analytics – Elastic Stack, Tableau, Highcharts, and more complex database solutions like Hadoop, Amazon AWS and Teradata, have wide applications in business, from monitoring performance to improving customer experience on mobile tools. New generation of data visualization based on AR and VR technology, however, provides formerly unfeasible advantages in terms of identifying patterns and drawing insights from various data streams.</p>
<p>Building 3D data visualization spaces, companies can create an intuitive environment that helps data scientists grasp and analyze more data streams at the same time, observe data points from multiple dimensions, identify previously unavailable dependencies and manipulate data by naturally moving objects, zooming, and focusing on more granulated areas. Moreover, these tools allow us to expand the capabilities of data visualization by creating collaborative 3D environments for teams. As a result, new technology helps extract more valuable insights from the same volume of data.</p>
<p><strong>3. Strategizing</strong></p>
<p>As the amount of data grows, it becomes harder to catch up with it. Therefore, data strategy becomes the necessary part of the success in applying data to business. Then how data visualization become an important tool in your strategic kit? First, it helps you cleanse your data. Secondly, it allows you to identify and extract meaningful information from it. Finally, data visualization tools enable continuous real-time monitoring of how your strategy and now data-driven decisions influence performance and business outcomes. In other words, these tools visualize not only the data, but also the results, and help correct and optimize strategy on the go.</p>
<p>Data visualization is one of the initial steps made to derive value from data. It’s also one of the most important steps, as it determines how efficiently analysts can work with data assets, what insights they are able to extract and how their data strategy will develop over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the quality and capabilities of data visualization directly influence how data impacts your business strategy and what benefits data applications can bring to the companies and their industries._</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Pick the Right Chart Type</h2>
<p>Data visualization is a combination of art and science. When it comes to the artistic aspect, there are no correct answers for doing the visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, when making sense of facts, numbers, and measurement, better understanding is promoted by a logical path to follow. To determine the best type of chart is hard for those new to data visualization. Most people learn it by referring to other people’s work without understanding the underlying logic, so they don’t have the theory in their mind to make the judgement.</p>
<p>When we are choosing the type of chart, we need to answer some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many features would you like to show in a chart?</li>
<li>How many data points do you want to display for each variable?</li>
<li>Will you display time serious data or among items or groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>After answered this question, you should able to get a better imagination of your ideal graph. The simple guidance for using different type of chart is line charts for tracking trends over time, bar charts to compare quantities, scatter plots for joint variation of two data items, bubble charts showing joint variation of three data items, and pie charts to compare parts of a whole.</p>
<p>Let’s review the most commonly used chart types and explain what circumstance should better use typical chart and the pros and cons of each type of chart. Before introduce different types of charts, you can use the following website to familiar with different types of charts <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="charts_viz"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Type 1 Column Charts.</strong> This should be the most popular chart type. This chart is good to do comparison between different values when specific values are important. TBD</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1</span> Typography and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>This article discusses less common applications of typography in data visualization. While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, and other typographic elements in data visualization are less prevalent.</p>
<p>Highlighted in the article are preattentive visual attributes; preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of how many items are displayed. Therefore, “preattentive visual attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and are virtually unaffected by load.” Examples of preattentive attributes are size/area, hue, and curvature.</p>
<p>This brings us to the disparate situation of the popularity of visual aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual attributes like size and hue.However, some typographic attributes such as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the two) are considered preattentive as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data visualizations by technological advances.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general, the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small group of people rather than all of the data visualization design community. I would say that it is more likely that the use of typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias—if current visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken. However, the authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization, other spheres like typography, cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming “have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space.”</p>
<p>The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>
<p>There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for data visualization in the article, not all of which I agree are made more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes, but the “Who Survived the Titanic” visualization’s use of typographic attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly, such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text replacement to indicate gender and the passengers names.</p>
<p>The authors round out the article by addressing the most common criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being whether or not text should even be considered an element of data visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more investment of attention to understand. Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that “this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type? that while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of higher level patterns. Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying lengths representations of passengers�? names, and was corrected by only including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only vary so much.</p>

<p>With the development, studies and new tools applied in data visualization, more people understand it matters <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="next_steps"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> . But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new approaches <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="next_steps"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adapting the Publication and Review Process:</strong> As the article states, “both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reviews could serve as valuable guides”, so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for fledgling practitioners in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting Discussion and Accretion:</strong> Discussion of research papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the online forum.</li>
<li><strong>Research Methods Training:</strong> Developing a core curriculum for data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS faculty organized a new course on <a href="http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/">Designing Computer Science Experiments</a>. Also, online resources could be reinforced with a catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided study to online courses. Useful examples include Jake Wobbrock’s Practical Statistics for HCI and Pierre Dragicevic’s resources for reforming statistical practice.</li>

<div id="using-data-visualization-to-find-insights-in-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Using Data Visualization to find insights in data</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="data_journ"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> is extracted from a book known as Data Journalism Handbook and this is one of the chapters of the book. The author starts the article by introducing a very simple idea that loading any data set into a spreadsheet can also be a form of visualization as an invisible data becomes visible in a picture form into a table. Hence the focus should not be whether we need data visualization or not but should be on which form of data visualization is best in which situation. The author then proceeds by stating that data visualization will not always unleash a ready made story on its own. Sometimes the insights are known before the visualization and sometimes an insight can be completely new. The author has given a process for finding insights in the following way:</p>
<p>Visualize Data-&gt; Analyze -&gt; Document Insights -&gt; Transform Datasets -&gt; Visualize Data</p>
<p>Each stage is explained in-depth further. Data Visualization can be done in many ways such as tables which are great for one dimensional data however they are bad for multi-dimensional data. Then he goes further to explain the situation where each type of visualization such as bar charts, maps, scatter plots, graphs, etc. are used. This gives a thorough understanding of when to use which type of visualization. Once we visualize the data we need to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can I see in this image? Is it what I expected?</li>
<li>Are there any interesting patterns?</li>
<li>What does this mean in the context of the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic question answer format gives an idea to the viewers about what kind of perspectives can we look at the data. Sometimes we discover something and sometimes we don’t. But the author mentions that we always learn something from the visualization. Once we document the data insights based on the above question we need to have the following points into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why have I created this chart?</li>
<li>What have I done to the data to create it?</li>
<li>What does this chart tell me?</li>
</ul>
<p>The above question answer format compels the viewers to think deeper about what exactly we are trying to find. Because many times the viewers are simply too overwhelmed with the size of data that they lose the basic idea. Hence this kind of approach help to stay focused. The author then mentions that based on the above insights we might have some idea about some interesting patterns. Since we already have an idea we might want to see it in more detail and hence we transform data in more details such as Zooming, Filtering, Outlier Removal. The author then explains how transformed data can help us to see a more detailed view of our insights.</p>
<p>Further the author gives a detailed explanation of which data visualization tool to use based on the situation. The entire process given above is explained in depth with the help of examples. The technical approach listed above is practical and can be implemented easily on our data visualization projects. I liked the author’s approach because he has cleverly integrated the step-by-step process of finding insights with the technical way of handling data sets using tools such as Tableau, Python, etc. And the process can be repeated many times till we find the insights we are looking for.</p>

Being transparent top down aligns the culture to sail towards the same North Star. The growth of corporate transparency is not only important internally, but externally as well. Corporate certifications like B Corporations certifications (B Corp), require companies to provide a transparent view on their social conscious efforts to the general public. Achieving the certification is one step of the process; the true goal is to show the world how and why the certification is truly deserved.</p>
<p>How does data visualization play a part? Data Visualization helps reveal insights and patterns that are not immediately visible in the raw data. Here’s the process on how to get it done:</p>

<td>Perform Data Discovery and Determine The Story</td>
<td>Before this step it is easy to underestimate the effort level it takes to pull the best insights from the data. Data manipulation products like Tableau, Domo, Pentaho, IBM’s Many Eyes, and R, among others, make insight extraction that much easier to gain understanding of data using a visual medium. The key is to start with a simple portion of your data and to start pulling basic insights to visualize and correlate with each other. This process leads towards a compound series of questions, which helps provide an overall vision to the end product. We see the effect during our discovery process, which leads to unforeseen avenues for data intelligence.</td>

<td>Data Infrastructure Setup</td>
<td>Data infrastructures can be simple or complex depending what the end goal is. Many clients prefer to go the route of complete data integration in order to centralize their data repositories. Technologies such as Hadoop have helped by unifying disparate data sources, but other options such as data cloud environments can help produce API’s for future product deployments. Why is this important? Accessibility of data is an important foundation not only within the context of dashboards, but also the possibility of branching out to other products.</td>

Products can range from static presentations/reports to full interactive applications. Mobile, tablet, TV, and workstation platforms can all be mediums to help deliver the final product. The secret to a great end product is how well the data story is conceptualized. If the story is weak then the end product will also suffer.</td>

<p><strong>Interactive Data Visualization</strong></p>
<p>In Data Mining, there are different processes involve carrying out the data mining process such as data extraction, data management, data transformations, data pre-processing, etc. In Data Visualization, the primary goal is to convey the information efficiently and clearly without any deviations or complexities in the form of statistical graphs, information graphs, and plots. Also, the author listed the top 7 comparisons between data mining and data visualization, and 12 key differences between data mining and data visualization. After reading the article, you will have a very clear understanding of what are data mining and data visualization and the characters for those two techniques.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.12</span> Interactive Data Visualization</h2>
<p>Interactive or Dynamic data visualization delivers today’s complex sea of data in a graphically compelling and an easy-to-understand way. It enables direct actions on a plot to change elements and link between multiple plots. It enables users to accomplish traditional data exploration tasks by making charts interactive<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="benefits_interactive_viz"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>Benefits of Interactive Data Visualization Software:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Absorb information in constructive ways: With the volume and velocity of data created everyday, dynamic data viz enables enhanced process optimization, insight discovery and decision making.</li>
<li>Visualize relationships and patterns: Helps in better understanding of correlations among operational data and business performance.</li>
<li>Identify and act on emerging trends faster: Helps decision makers to grasp shifts in behaviors and trends across multiple data sets much more quickly.</li>
<li>Manipulate and interact directly with data: Enables users to engage data more frequently.</li>
<li>Foster a new business language : Ability to tell a story through data that instantly relates the performance of a business and its assets.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>There are multiple ways by which interactive data visualizations can be developed:</strong></p>
<div id="d3.js" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.12.1</span> D3.js</h3>
<p>D3.js stands for Data Driven Document, a JS library for interactive Big Data visualization in literally ANY way required real-time<span class="citation">(Cabot Technology Solution <a href="#ref-d3_interactive_viz">2017</a>)</span>. This is not a tool, mind you, so a user should have a solid understanding of JavaScript to work with the data and present it in a humanly-understandable form. To say more, this library renders the data into SVG and HTML5 formats, so older browsers like IE7 and 8 cannot leverage D3.js capabilities.</p>
<p>The data gathered from disparate sources like huge-scale data sets is bind in real-time with DOM to produce interactive animations ( 2D and 3D alike) in an extremely rapid way. The D3 architecture allows the users to intensively reuse the codes across a variety of add-ons and plug-ins. Some of the key advantages are: It is dynamic, free and open source and very flexible with all web technologies, the ability to handle big data and the functional style allows to reuse the codes.</p>
<p><strong>The Hitchhiker’ Guide to d3.js</strong> is a wonderful guide for self-teaching d3.js. This guide is meant to prepare readers mentally as well as give readers some fruitful directions to pursue. There is a lot to learn besides the d3.js API, both technical knowledge around web standards like HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript as well as communication concepts and data visualization principles. Chances are you know something about some of those things, so this guide will attempt to give you good starting points for the things you want to learn more about.</p>
<p>It starts from the insights of learning d3.js by showing interviews with those top visualization practitioners. Then the author gives key concepts and useful features for learning visualization like d3-shape, d3 selection, d3-collection, ds-hierarchy, ds-zoom as well as d3-force.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this guide is it lists a lot of useful resources links for learning d3.js. For example, it recommends d3 API Reference, 2000+ d3 case studies and tutorials for d3. I did my exploratory analysis version of group project on d3. And I found this guide helpful during the progress. It also includes some meetup groups here in the bay area. So, maybe we can meet data friends through the group.</p>

<div id="tableau" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.12.2</span> Tableau</h3>
<p>Tableau is amid the market leaders for the Big Data visualization, especially efficient for delivering interactive data visualization for the results derived from Big Data operations, deep learning algorithms and multiple types of AI-driven apps <span class="citation">(AbsentData <a href="#ref-tableau_interactive_viz">2018</a>)</span>. Tableau can be integrated with Amazon AWS, MySQL, Hadoop, Teradata and SAP, making this solution a versatile tool for creating detailed graphs and intuitive data representation. This way the C-suite and middle-chain managers are able to make grounded decisions based on informative and easily-readable Tableau graphs. Tableau is business intelligence (BI) and analytics platform created for the purposes of helping people see, understand, and make decisions with data. It is the industry leader in interactive data visualization tools, offering a broad range of maps, charts, graphs, and more graphical data presentations. It is a painless option when cost is not a concern and you do not need advanced and complex analysis.The application is very handy for quickly visualizing trends in data, connecting to a variety of data sources, and mapping cities/regions and their associated data.</p>
<p>The key advantages are: It provides non technical user the ability to build complex reports and dashboard with zero coding skills. Using drag-n-drop functionalities of Tableau, user can create a very interactive visuals within minutes. It can handle millions of rows of data with ease and users can make live to connections to different data sources like SQL etc.</p>

<div id="r-shiny" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.12.3</span> R Shiny</h3>
<p>R Shiny enables us to produce interactive data visualizations with a minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Java using a simple web application framework that runs under the R statistical platform <span class="citation">(Castañón <a href="#ref-shiny_interactive_viz">2016</a>)</span>. Standalone apps can be hosted on a webpage or embedded in R Markdown documents and dashboards can be built using R shiny. It combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. The main advantages of using R Shiny are : Its flexibility of pulling in whatever package in R that you want to solve your problem, reaping the benefits of an open source ecosystem for R and JavaScript visualization libraries, thereby allowing to create highly custom applications and enabling timely, high quality interactive data experience without (or with much less) web development and without the limitations or cost of proprietary BI tools.</p>

<div id="tuftes-design-principles-of-graphical-excellence" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.13</span> Tufte’s Design Principles of graphical excellence</h2>
<p>A graph should be impressive and can obtain audience’s attention. How can we achieve this? We must consider several aspects: <strong>efficiency, complexity, structure, density and beauty</strong>. We also should consider the audience whether they will be confused about the design. Statistical graphics are kind of graphics we use a lot for data analysis so I want to summarize some principles mentioned in this Tufte’s great book.Here we must follow some principles for statistical graphics:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within reason.</strong> Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.</p>
<p>Data-ink ratio = data-ink/total ink used to print the graphic = proportion of graphic’s ink devoted to the non-redundant display of data-information</p>
<p>This basic principle follows by two principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Erase non-data-ink, within reason.</li>
<li>Erase redundant data-ink, within reason.</li>
<li>always revise and edit.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure1.png" alt="Erase non-data-ink and redundant data-ink" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure2.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Plotly <a href="#ref-appli_2017">2017</a>)</span>)</p>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure3.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Plotly <a href="#ref-appli_2017">2017</a>)</span>)</p>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure4.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The graphs will be better for more information per unit of space an d per unit of ink is displayed.</li>
<li>Graphics are almost always going to improve as they go through editing ,revision, and testing against different design options.</li>
<li>Try to figure out whether the audience looking at the new designs be confused? Nothing is lost to those puzzled by the frame of dashes,and something is gained by those who do understand. We can also assume that if you understand the statistical graphics, most other readers will, too because it is a frequent mistake in thinking about statistical graphics to underestimate the audience.</li>
<li>Some of the new designs may appear odd, but this is probably because we have not seen them before.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data.</strong> The danger of multi-functioning elements is that they tend to generate graphical puzzles, with encodings that can only be broken by their inventor.Thus design techniques for enhancing graphical clarity in the face of complexity must be developed along with multi-functioning elements. In other words, we should try to make all present graphical elements data encoding elements.We must make every graphical element effective.</p>
<p>Example: <img src="images/Tufte_figure6.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: maximize data density and the size of the data matrix, within reason.</strong> High performance graphics should be design with special care. As volume of data increases, data measures must shrink (smaller dots for scatters,thinner lines for busy time-series) <span class="citation">(J.Camm and Shaffer <a href="#ref-best-practice">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Data Density = # entries in data matrix /area of data graphic</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4: Escape flatland – small multiples, parallel sequencing.</strong> Data is multivariate. Does not’t necessarily mean 3D projection. How can we enhance multivariate data on inherently 2D surfaces?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Example for small multiples. <img src="images/Tufte_figure8.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Example for parallel sequencing <img src="images/Tufte_figure7.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principle 5: Macro/Micro-Provide the user with both views (overview and detail).</strong> Carefully designed view can show a macro structure (overview) as well as micro structure (detail) in one space.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<img src="images/Tufte_figure9.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Principle 6: Utilize Layering &amp; Separation.</strong> Supported by Gestalt laws (The principles of grouping): 1. Grouping with colors 2. Using Color to separate 3. 1+1 = 3 (clutter)</p>
<p>Example: <img src="images/Tufte_figure10.png" /> (source:<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Tufte_2001"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Principle 7: Utilize narratives of space and time.</strong> Tell a story of position and chronology through visual elements.</p>
<p>Example: <img src="images/Tufte_figure11.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Periscope <a href="#ref-narratives_2017">2018</a>)</span>) <img src="images/Tufte_figure12.png" /> (source: <span class="citation">(Periscope <a href="#ref-narratives_2017">2018</a>)</span>)</p>

<div id="visual-data-communication" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.14</span> Visual Data Communication</h2>
<p>We want visualizations to speak about the data. This article is about some tips that can help visualizations to speak:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Keep charts simple and easy to interpret. Instead of overloading peoples brain with lots of information, keep only the necessary things in the chart and help the audience understand quickly what’s going on.</li>
<li><strong>Pretty doesn’t mean effective:</strong> There is a misconception that aesthetically pleasing visualization is more effective.To draw attention, sometimes we want them to be pretty and eye-catching. But if it fails to communicate that data properly, then you’ll lose people’s interest as quickly as you gained it.</li>
<li><strong>Color for Numerical Scales:</strong> Color for numerical scales should be used with caution.The way you interpret a shade depends on the colors around it and sometimes it can lead to false conclusions.For data with geographical fields, it may be tempting to use maps. But maps may not be very effective for the following reasons:</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Color Associations:</strong> When we say strawberries we associate red color with it. If we can leverage the how people associate different colors for different things, we will not even need legend to interpret things. Color can be used to leverage long-term memory very quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Use Bright Colors to Highlight:</strong> To attract attention to a certain part of data, bright colors can be used. Alarm colors draw the eye quickly to areas that need attention and help get that message across.</li>
<li><strong>Maps</strong> Use of maps can be tricky. Geographical data doesn’t imply a map. Maps can be useful for application where proximity matters they can be great for applications where proximity matters, but for straight “what is higher” type comparisons, they’re not very effective as large regions will draw attention easier than smaller regions due to more concentrated color.</li>
<li><strong>5 Second Rule:</strong> Research shows that on average modern attention span for looking at things online is less than 5 seconds. So if you can’t grab attention within 5 minutes, you’ve likely lost your viewer. Includes clear titles and instructions and tell people succinctly what the visualization shows and how to interact with it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="gestalt-principles-for-data-viz" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.15</span> Gestalt Principles for Data Viz</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(FusionCharts <a href="#ref-principles-fusioncharts">2012</a>)</span> is a detailed white paper PDF from FusionCharts that explores key aspects of effective data visualization in the business world, from goals to preattentive attributes to applying Gestalt Principles. Because some of the aspects such as using color and design effectively have been covered earlier on in the Fundamentals section, this summary will mainly focus on the Gestalt Principles.</p>
<p>Data is simply a collection of many individual elements (i.e.,, observations, typically represented as rows in a data table). In data viz, our goal is usually to group these elements together in a meaningful way to highlight patterns and anomalies. Described this way, it makes sense that Gestalt Principles are a good set of guidelines for data viz, because these principles describe how we assemble different elements into groups.</p>
<p><strong>The Gestalt Principles include the following:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Proximity: white space can be used to group elements together and separate others</li>
<li>Similarity: objects that look similar are instinctively grouped together in our minds</li>
<li>Enclosure: helps distinguish between groups</li>
<li>Symmetry</li>
<li>Closure: we tend to complete shapes and paths even if part of them is missing</li>
<li>Continuity: similar to closure</li>
<li>Connection: helps group elements together as well</li>
<li>Figure and ground: we typically notice only one of several main visual aspects of a graph; what we do notice becomes the figure, and everything else becomes the “background”. This one is especially interesting because it is not as obvious as some of the others, but is really important in matching a data viz design to its purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>The principles are quite theoretical and in practice, preattentive attributes such as spatial position, size, and color are means of applying the principles.</p>
