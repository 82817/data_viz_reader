<td>Perform Data Discovery and Determine The Story</td>
<td>Before this step it is easy to underestimate the effort level it takes to pull the best insights from the data. Data manipulation products like Tableau, Domo, Pentaho, IBM’s Many Eyes, and R, among others, make insight extraction that much easier to gain understanding of data using a visual medium. The key is to start with a simple portion of your data and to start pulling basic insights to visualize and correlate with each other. This process leads towards a compound series of questions, which helps provide an overall vision to the end product. We see the effect during our discovery process, which leads to unforeseen avenues for data intelligence.</td>

<td>Data Infrastructure Setup</td>
<td>Data infrastructures can be simple or complex depending what the end goal is. Many clients prefer to go the route of complete data integration in order to centralize their data repositories. Technologies such as Hadoop have helped by unifying disparate data sources, but other options such as data cloud environments can help produce API’s for future product deployments. Why is this important? Accessibility of data is an important foundation not only within the context of dashboards, but also the possibility of branching out to other products.</td>

The secret to a great end product is how well the data story is conceptualized. If the story is weak then the end product will also suffer.</td>

<p>In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare quality assets to derive valuable insights.</p>
<div id="storytelling" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Storytelling</h2>
<p>Storytelling is an essential part of data visualization. It is extremely important to effectively communicate information through the visualization. Stikeleather’s article (2013) discussed the way in which a visual designer tells a story with a visualization.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the compelling narrative</li>
<li>Think about the audience (e.g., novice, generalist, managerial, export, executive)</li>
<li>Be objective and offer balance</li>
<li>Don’t censor</li>
</ol>
<p>Data visualization will not always unleash a ready-made story on its own. There are no rules, no ‘protocol’ that will guarantee us a story. Instead, it makes more sense to look for ‘insights,’ which can be artfully woven into stories in the hands of a good journalist.</p>
<p>Here is a process that may be followed for finding insights to tell a story:</p>

<p>Loading any data set into a spreadsheet can also be a form of visualization as the data becomes visible in a table. Hence the focus should not be whether we need data visualization or not but should be on which form of data visualization is best for the situation.</p>

<div id="second-rule" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> 5 Second Rule</h3>
<p>Research shows that the average modern attention span for viewing anything online is less than 5 seconds, so if you can’t grab attention within 5 minutes, you’ve likely lost your viewer. Include clear titles and instructions, and tell people succinctly what the visualization shows and how to interact with it.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Design and layout matter</h3>
<p>The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer.</p>
<p>Artists use design principles as the foundation of any visual work. If you want to take your data visualization from an everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate graphic designer Melissa Anderson’s principles of design: balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity, discussed in more detail in the design principles section <span class="citation">(Anderson <a href="#ref-design_principles">2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Keep it simple</h3>

<div id="pretty-doesnt-mean-effective" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5</span> Pretty doesn’t mean effective</h3>
<p>There is a misconception that aesthetically pleasing visualization is more effective. To draw attention, sometimes we want them to be pretty and eye-catching. But if it fails to communicate the data properly, you’ll lose your audience’s interest as quickly as you gained it.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Analyze and Interpret</h3>
<p>Once the data is visualized, the next step is to learn something from the picture that is created. Questions that can be asked based on the picture can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can be seen in this image? Is it what that was expected?</li>
<li>Are there any interesting patterns?</li>
<li>What does this mean in the context of the data?</li>
</ul>

<div id="document-your-insights-and-steps" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Document Your Insights and Steps</h3>
<p>If you think of this process as a journey through the dataset, the documentation is your travel diary. It will tell you where you have traveled to, what you have seen there and how you made your decisions for your next steps. You can even start your documentation before taking your first look at the data.</p>
<p>In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset, we are already full of expectations and assumptions about the data. Usually, there is a reason why we are interested in that dataset that we are looking at. It’s a good idea to start the documentation by writing down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and reduces the risk of misinterpretation of the data by just finding what we originally wanted to find.</p>
<p>I really think that the documentation is the most important step of the process, and it is also the one we’re most likely to tend to skip. As you will see in the example below, the described process involves a lot of plotting and data wrangling. Looking at a set of 15 charts you created might be very confusing, especially after some time has passed. In fact, those charts are only valuable (to you or any other person you want to communicate your findings) if presented in the context in which they have been created. Hence you should take the time to make some notes on things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why have I created this chart?</li>
<li>What have I done to the data to create it?</li>
<li>What does this chart tell me?</li>

<td>Balance</td>
<td>A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color, shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed. Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualization distributed evenly. And it is important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc. that can affect the balance of the display.</td>

<td>Variety</td>
<td>Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be overlooked. Variety may affect balance, but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.</td>

<td>Emphasis</td>
<td>Draw viewers’ attention towards important data by using key visual elements. Emphasis is the component that is most related to when reading through the nine principles of design. It is the key to be conscious of what is drawing the viewers attention to the art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</td>

The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously.Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization. If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going to look bigger. In data visualization, the proportion can indicate the importance of data sets, along with the actual relationship between numbers.</td>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Tufte’s Design Principles of Graphical Excellence</h3>
<p>A graph should be impressive and can obtain audience’s attention. How can we achieve this? We must consider several aspects: <strong>efficiency, complexity, structure, density and beauty</strong>. We also should consider the audience whether they will be confused about the design.</p>
<div id="principle-1-maximizing-the-data-ink-ratio-within-reason." class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.1</span> Principle 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within reason.</h4>
<p>Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. It is also the proportion of graphic’s ink devoted to the non-redundant display of data-information.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{Data \ Ink \ Ratio} = \frac{{Data \ Ink}}{{Total \ Ink}}\]</span></p>
<p>This basic idea follows three principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Erase non-data-ink, within reason.</li>
<li>Erase redundant data-ink, within reason.</li>
<li>Always revise and edit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples: 1.Erase non-data-ink and redundant data-ink. <img src="images/Tufte_figure1.png" /> <sup>(source:<span class="citation">(Tufte <a href="#ref-Tufte_2001">2001</a>)</span>)</sup></p>

<p>The graphs will be better for more information per unit of space and per unit of ink is displayed. Graphics are almost always going to improve as they go through editing ,revision, and testing against differernt design options. Try to figure out whehter the audience looking at the new designs be confused? Nothing is lost to those puzzled by the frame of dashes,and something isgained by those who do understand. We can also assume that if you understand the statistical graphics, most other readers will, too because it is a frequent mistake in thinking about statistical graphics to underestimate the audience. Some of the new designs may appear odd, but this is probably because we have not seen them before.</p>

<p>In other words, we should try to make all present graphical elements data encoding elements. We must make every graphical element effective.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.4</span> Adapting your story to a different set of audiences</h3>
<p>Jonathon Corum is a graphics designer for The New York Times and he provided a very informative talk to a strictly scientific audience on how to create and design visualizations that explain material originally created for a certain audience, i.e. the scientific community, but now is to be related to a different audience, (in his case, the readership of the Times or maybe the public at large). The talk is filled with examples and break downs of how he has moved from his base content to the final product, all of which are illuminating examples by themselves. There is also great power in the broader themes that he is trying to convey.</p>
<p>First, of course is knowing the audience that you are producing the work for, but even in this step, do not lose sight of the ultimate goal of conveying understanding, of explaining a concept. You are searching for a visual idea in your content that can be communicated to your audience. Some of the main highlights to help you make this connection with your audience involve:</p>

The author used apps Excel, Plotly, Easycharts, Google Sheets, Lyra, Highcharts, Tableau, Polestar, Quadrigram, Illustrator, RAW, and NodeBox, as well as charting libraries ggvis, Bokeh, Highcharts, ggplot2, Processing, NVD3, Seaborn, Vega, D3, matplotlib, Vega-Lite, and R. She links her github page on the project which details the data set she used, containing the health expectancy in years as well as GDP per capita and population for about 200 countries in the year 2015, as well has her process and results of visualizing the data using each tool.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.6.1</span> There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for People with Certain Goals</h4>
<p>Since data visualization is necessary in many spheres, from science to journalism, data visualization projects will often have quite disparate objectives, and the people working on them will have different requirements. And as the author aptly points out, it is impossible for one tool to satisfy the needs of every data visualizer; so there will necessarily be tools better suited to specific situations. For example, does the user need a tool for exploratory visualization of the data, or does the user seek to create graphs and charts to show the public or a specific audience something?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/analysis_spectrum.png" />

</div>
<p>The author also notes that the flexibility of a tool is a sticking point as well—if you need to change your data while developing a data visualization, certain apps like Illustrator will not be ideal because changing the data even slightly requires you to build the graph again from scratch. Another thing to think about is the type of chart you are trying to create—is a basic, canned bar or line graph all you need (in which case something like Excel will do the trick), or does your project necessitate a more innovative or custom chart (like something possible in D3.js)? Interactivity is another big question—only certain tools will make this possible.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.7</span> Typography and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>This article discusses less common applications of typography in data visualization. While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, and other typographic elements in data visualization are less prevalent.</p>
<p><strong>Highlighted in the article are preattentive visual attributes.</strong> Preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of how many items are displayed. Therefore, “preattentive visual attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and are virtually unaffected by load.” Examples of preattentive attributes are size/area, hue, and curvature.</p>
<p>This brings us to the disparate situation of the popularity of visual aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual attributes like size and hue.However, some typographic attributes such as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the two) are considered preattentive as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data visualizations by technological advances.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general, the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small group of people rather than all of the data visualization design community. I would say that it is more likely that the use of typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias—if current visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken. However, the authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization, other spheres like typography, cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming “have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space.”</p>
<p>The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>
<p>There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for data visualization in the article, not all of which I agree are made more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes, but the “Who Survived the Titanic” visualization’s use of typographic attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly, such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text replacement to indicate gender and the passengers names.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/TypographicTitanic.jpg" />

</div>
<p>The authors round out the article by addressing the most common criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being whether or not text should even be considered an element of data visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more investment of attention to understand. Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that “this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type? that while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of higher level patterns. Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying lengths representations of passengers’ names, and was corrected by only including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only vary so much.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.8</span> Data visualization in Business</h3>
<p><span class="citation">(Lazarevich <a href="#ref-biz_strategy">2018</a>)</span> According to an Experian report, 95% of U.S. organizations say that they use data to power business opportunities, and another 84 percent believe data is an integral part of forming a business strategy. Visualization helps data impact business in following ways:</p>
<div id="cleaning" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.8.1</span> Cleaning</h4>
<p>The simplest way to explain the importance of visualization is to look at visualization as the means to making sense of data. Even the most basic, widely-used data visualization tools that combine simple pie charts and bar graphs help people comprehend large amounts of information fast and easily, compared to paper reports and spreadsheets. In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare quality assets to derive valuable insights.</p>
</div>
<div id="extracting" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.8.2</span> Extracting</h4>
<p>Known versatile tools for data visualization and analytics – Elastic Stack, Tableau, Highcharts, and more complex database solutions like Hadoop, Amazon AWS and Teradata, have wide applications in business, from monitoring performance to improving customer experience on mobile tools. New generation of data visualization based on AR and VR technology, however, provides formerly unfeasible advantages in terms of identifying patterns and drawing insights from various data streams.</p>
<p>Building 3D data visualization spaces, companies can create an intuitive environment that helps data scientists grasp and analyze more data streams at the same time, observe data points from multiple dimensions, identify previously unavailable dependencies and manipulate data by naturally moving objects, zooming, and focusing on more granulated areas. Moreover, these tools allow us to expand the capabilities of data visualization by creating collaborative 3D environments for teams. As a result, new technology helps extract more valuable insights from the same volume of data.</p>
</div>
<div id="strategizing" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.8.3</span> Strategizing</h4>
<p>As the amount of data grows, it becomes harder to catch up with it. Therefore, data strategy becomes the necessary part of the success in applying data to business. Then how data visualization become an important tool in your strategic kit? First, it helps you cleanse your data. Secondly, it allows you to identify and extract meaningful information from it. Finally, data visualization tools enable continuous real-time monitoring of how your strategy and now data-driven decisions influence performance and business outcomes. In other words, these tools visualize not only the data, but also the results, and help correct and optimize strategy on the go.</p>
<p>Data visualization is one of the initial steps made to derive value from data. It’s also one of the most important steps, as it determines how efficiently analysts can work with data assets, what insights they are able to extract and how their data strategy will develop over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the quality and capabilities of data visualization directly influence how data impacts your business strategy and what benefits data applications can bring to the companies and their industries.</p>

<p>D3.js stands for Data Driven Document, a JS library for interactive Big Data visualization in literally ANY way required real-time<span class="citation">(Cabot Technology Solution <a href="#ref-d3_interactive_viz">2017</a>)</span>. This is not a tool, mind you, so a user should have a solid understanding of JavaScript to work with the data and present it in a humanly-understandable form. To say more, this library renders the data into SVG and HTML5 formats, so older browsers like IE7 and 8 cannot leverage D3.js capabilities.</p>
<p>The data gathered from disparate sources like huge-scale data sets is bind in real-time with DOM to produce interactive animations ( 2D and 3D alike) in an extremely rapid way. The D3 architecture allows the users to intensively reuse the codes across a variety of add-ons and plug-ins. Some of the key advantages are: It is dynamic, free and open source and very flexible with all web technologies, the ability to handle big data and the functional style allows to reuse the codes.</p>
<p><strong>The Hitchhiker’ Guide to d3.js</strong> is a wonderful guide for self-teaching d3.js. This guide is meant to prepare readers mentally as well as give readers some fruitful directions to pursue. There is a lot to learn besides the d3.js API, both technical knowledge around web standards like HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript as well as communication concepts and data visualization principles. Chances are you know something about some of those things, so this guide will attempt to give you good starting points for the things you want to learn more about.</p>
<p>It starts from the insights of learning d3.js by showing interviews with those top visualization practitioners. Then the author gives key concepts and useful features for learning visualization like d3-shape, d3 selection, d3-collection, ds-hierarchy, ds-zoom as well as d3-force.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this guide is it lists a lot of useful resources links for learning d3.js. For example, it recommends d3 API Reference, 2000+ d3 case studies and tutorials for d3. I did my exploratory analysis version of group project on d3. And I found this guide helpful during the progress. It also includes some meetup groups here in the bay area. So, maybe we can meet data friends through the group.</p>

<p>Because computer interfacing is changing every day, it is important for our clients to adapt the technology. The language of communicating data in 3D is explored to understand ways to take advantage of all dimensions in augmented reality and virtual reality to deliver information based on the user’s perspective, interest, and urgency.</p>
<p>Creating a mechanism to become aware of the user’s intention by analyzing the gaze through reactive design, we achieved developing a complex system for demonstrating massive amount of data and organizing it in a spatial system. The user could walk through and explore the data and interact with different data visualizations. Moving through space is used to provide different levels of detail for specific data through Z axis.</p>
<p>Analytical engineer Steluta Iordache states that virtual reality is changing the environment of data analysis. It has long been predicted that augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will, sooner rather than later, dive head first into the mainstream of public consciousness. Now, expectations are beginning to meet reality, and as tech giants such as Facebook, Samsung, and Google place heavy investments in these sectors, this seems inevitable. However, placing the headsets and gaming to one side (most experts believe AR and VR will most dynamically disrupt the gaming industry), these nascent technologies can be used by corporate organizations, too.</p>
<p>By using proper visualization, it is possible to simplify understanding of a problem and discover a solution more easily. Recently, we have seen data integrated in the real world and users have been able to interact with that data, which is not possible with traditional methods such as plots and charts. We believe AR and VR can build the presentation of the data and show more information at the same time, as well as allow the viewer to explore the data by interacting with it. However, when we analyze data it can be difficult to see the big picture while also having access to finer details. So the question is: how can AR and VR be used to understand complex data by interacting with it within a virtual environment?

But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new approaches <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="next_steps"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adapting the Publication and Review Process:</strong> As the article states, “both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reviews could serve as valuable guides,” so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for fledgling practitioners in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting Discussion and Accretion:</strong> Discussion of research papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the online forum.</li>
<li><strong>Research Methods Training:</strong> Developing a core curriculum for data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS faculty organized a new course on <a href="http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/">Designing Computer Science Experiments</a>. Also, online resources could be reinforced with a catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided study to online courses.
