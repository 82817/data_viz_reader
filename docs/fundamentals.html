<li>Theoretical background of data visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>History Data visualization has comes a long way. Prior to the 17th century, data visualization already exists. Though display in other format such as maps, the content are much similar to today’s visualization, which mostly presented geologic, economic, and medical data. Here is useful link: <a href="http://www.dashboardinsight.com/news/news-articles/the-history-of-data-visualization.aspx" class="uri">http://www.dashboardinsight.com/news/news-articles/the-history-of-data-visualization.aspx</a></p>
<p>Current research: Deceptive visualizations Data visualization is a powerful communication tool to support arguments with numbers in a way that is accessible and engaging. More people than ever before are making their own charts and infographics, which is presenting a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading or downright deceptive data visualizations.

<pre><code>The only new thing in the world is the history you don’t know. — Harry S Truman

This paper provides an overview of the intellectual history of data visualization from medieval to modern times,
describing and illustrating some significant advances along the way.</code></pre>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data Visualization: modern product?</p>
<p>It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots.These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields.</p>
<p>Developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and<br />
recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content.</p></li>
<li><p>Milestones Tour</p>
<p>2.1 Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams</p>
<pre><code>  The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of stars and other
  celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration. </code></pre>
<p>2.2 1600-1699: Measurement and theory</p>
<pre><code>  Among the most important problems of the 17th century were those concerned with physical measurement— of time,
  distance,and space— for astronomy, surveying, map making, navigation and territorial expansion. This century also
  saw great new growth in theory and the dawnof practical application.</code></pre>
<p>2.3 1700-1799: New graphic forms</p>
<pre><code>  With some rudiments of statistical theory, data of interest and importance, and the idea of graphic representation
  at least somewhat established, the 18th century witnessed the expansion of these aspects to new domains and new
  graphic forms. </code></pre>
<p>2.4 1800-1850: Beginnings of modern graphics</p>
<pre><code>  With the fertilization provided by the previous innovations of design and technique, the first half of the 19th
  century witnessed explosive growth in statistical graphics and thematic mapping, at a rate which would not be
  equalled until modern times.</code></pre>
<p>2.5 1850–1900: The Golden Age of statistical graphics</p>
<pre><code>  By the mid-1800s, all the conditions for the rapid growth of visualization had been established— a “perfect storm”
  for data graphics. Official state statistical offices were established throughout Europe, in recognition of the
  growing importance of numerical information for social planning,industrialization, commerce, and transportation. 

   2.5.1 Escaping flatland
   2.5.2 Graphical innovations
   2.5.3 Galton’s contributions
   2.5.4 Statistical Atlases</code></pre>
<p>2.6 1900-1950: The modern dark ages</p>
<pre><code>  If the late 1800s were the “golden age” of statistical graphics and thematic cartography, the early 1900s can be
  called the “modern dark ages” of visualization. There were few graphical innovations, and, by the mid-1930s, the
  enthusiasm for visualization which characterized the late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of quantification
  and formal, often statistical, models in the social sciences.</code></pre>
<p>2.7 1950–1975: Re-birth of data visualization</p>
<pre><code>  Still under the influence of the formal and numerical zeitgeist from the mid-1930s on, data visualization began to
  rise from dormancy in the mid 1960s. </code></pre>
<p>2.8 1975–present: High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualization</p>
<pre><code>  During the last quarter of the 20th century data visualization has blossomed into a mature, vibrant and multi
  disciplinary research area, as may be seen in this Handbook, and software tools for a wide range of visualization
  methods and data types are available for every desktop computer.</code></pre></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> 2. Fundamental Components of Design</h2>
<p>Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity as the design foundation of any work. If you want to take your data visualization from an everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the 9 principles of design from graphic designer Melissa Anderson’s article: <a href="https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/07/26/data-visualization-and-the-9-fundamental-design-principles/" class="uri">https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/07/26/data-visualization-and-the-9-fundamental-design-principles/</a></p>
<p>Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualiaztion distributed evenly. And it important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc., that can affect the balance of the display.</p>
<p>Another closely related component to balance is variety which could seem counter to balance, but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.</p>
<p>Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer’s experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.</p>
<p>Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through the nine principles of design in this article. From prior experience with art through photography I understand it is key to be concious of what I am drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="guide-to-best-practices-in-data-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> 3. Guide to Best Practices in Data Visualization</h2>
<p>These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and then focus your visualization with respect to those questions.</p>
<p>The brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways – unconscious (System 1 represents uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 – represents controlled function such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System -1 which can have a quick and correct impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows:</p>
<p>** 1. Design and layout matter <strong> The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer. </strong> 2. Avoid Clutter <strong> Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio – the ratio of ink required to convey the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That means, avoid ink which do not add any information. </strong> 3. Use color purposely and effectively ** Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists in conveying your message. The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above principles.And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> 4. Survey of Popular Data Visualization Tools</h2>
<p>Due to the rise of big data analytics, there has been an increased need for data visualization tools to help understand the data. Besides Tableau, there are several other software tools one can use for data visualization like Sisense, Plotly, FusionCharts, Highcharts, Datawrapper, and Qlikview. This article is from forbes and has a brief, clear introduction about these 7 powerful software options for data visualization. This could be helpful for future reference because for different purposes I may need to use different tools. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages and this article helps highlight them.</p>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong> is the most popular of the group and has many users. It is simple to use, making it easy to learn and can handle large datasets. Tableau can handle big data thanks to integration with database handling applications such as MySQL, Hadoop, and Amazon AWS.</p>
<p><strong>Qlikview</strong> is the main competitor to Tableau and is also quite popular. Qlikview is customizable and has a wide range of features which can be a double-edged sword. These features take more time to learn and get acquianted with. However, once one gets past the learning curve, they have a powerful tool at their disposal.</p>
<p>The distinctive aspect of <strong>FusionCharts</strong> is that graphics do not have to be created from scratch. Users can start with a template and insert their own data from their project.</p>
<p><strong>Highcharts</strong> proudly claims to be used by 72% of the 100 biggest companies in the world. It is a simple tool that does not require specialized training and quickly generates the desired output. Unlike some tools, Highcharts focuses on cross- browser support, allowing for greater access and use.</p>
<p><strong>Datawrapper</strong> is making a name for itself in the media industry. It has a simple user interface making it easy to generate charts and embed into reports.</p>
<p><strong>Plotly</strong> can create more sophisticated visuals thanks to integration with programming languages such as Python and R. The danger is creating something more complicated than necessary. The whole point of data visualization is to quickly and clearly convey information.</p>
<p><strong>Sisense</strong> can bring together multiple sources of data for easier access. It can even work with large datasets. Sisense makes it easy to share finished products across departments, ensuring everyone can get the information they need.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> 5. Pick the Right Chart Type!</h2>
<p>Data divusalization is combining the art and science. As for the art, we can say there are no correct answers for doing the visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, how to making sense of facts, numbers and measurement for better understanding is still have a logical path to follow.</p>
<p>To determine which kind of chart is hard for those people new to data visulization. Most people learn it by refering some other people’s work without understanding the logic behind. So they don’t have the theory in their mind to make the judgement. Here , I will introduce some guidance to choose the charts.</p>
<p>When we about to choose the type of chart, we need to answer some questions. - How many features would you like to show in a chart? - how many data points do you want to display for each variable? - Will you display time serious data or among items or groups.</p>
<p>After answered this question, you shoul able to get a better imagenation of your ideal graph. The simple guidance for using different type of chart is line charts for tracking trends over time, bar charts to compare quantities, scatter plots for joint variation of two data items, bubble charts showing joint variation of three data items, and pie charts to compare parts of a whole.</p>
<p>Let’s review the most commonly used chart types and expalin what circumstance should better use typical chart and the pros and conts of each type of chart. Before introduce differnt types of charts, you can use the following website to familiar with different types of charts. <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/">The Data Visualisation Catalogue</a></p>
<p><strong>Type 1 Column Charts.</strong> This should be the most popular chart type. This chart is good to do comparison between different values when specific values are important. TBD</p>
<p>Still have hard time to choose? There are many resources on line can help you do the decision. For example, Dr. Andre Abela create a chart selection diagram that is helpful to pick the right chart depends on the data type.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> 6. Guide for Developing Dashboards</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/intuitive-dashboard-design" class="uri">https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/intuitive-dashboard-design</a> Three rules to follow in order to develop intuitive dashboards:</p>
<pre><code>1. the dashboard should read left to right
2. group related information together
3. find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.</code></pre>
<p>Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead to effective presentation of the data.</p>
<p>Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader’s eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important. Annual data is usually more important to a business but daily or weekly data could be used more often for day to day work. This should be kept in mind when designing a dashboard as dashboards are often used as a quick convenient way to look up data.</p>
<p>Grouping related data together is an intuitive way to help the flow of the visual. It does not make sense for a user to have to search in different areas to find the information they need.</p>
<p>Grouping unrelated data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the important thing is to tell a story not previously observed. Data analytics is all about finding stories the data is trying to tell. Once they are discovered, the stories need to be presented in an effective manner. Grouping unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they change together.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> 7. Definions of Date Deception and Graphic Integrity</h2>
<p>Data visualization becomes more and more pupular to communicate and support arguments nowdays. There are lots of great resources online to create and design amazing data products, in the same time, there are some poorly-designed misleading deceptive data visualizations.</p>
<p>So what does <strong>data deception</strong> mean? Data deception, defined by School of Law at the New York University, as “a graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message.”</p>
<p>In reality, decades ago, Edward Tufte already introduced the concept of graphical intergrity in his book and presented six principles of graphic integrity. Here are the principles from book:</p>
<pre><code>1. The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly
proportional to the numerical quantities measured.

2. Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out
explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.

3. Show data variation, not design variation.

4. In time-series displays of money, deﬂated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than
nominal units.

5. The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the
data.

6.Graphics must not quote data out of context.</code></pre>

<p><strong>Misleading graphs:</strong></p>
<p>Misleading graphs or distorted graphs, are graphs created which skews the data, intentionally or unintentionally, resulting in a representation of incorrect conclusions.</p>
<p>There are some ways in which distorted graphs can be created: 1. Improper scaling of y axis: This is one of the classic misleading graphs. Instead of scale starting from zero or a baseline, y axis is scaled conveniently to highlight the differences among bins. 2. Improper labelling of graphs: Lack of labels make the graph hard to interpret for the reader and lead to wrong conclusions. 3. Paired graphs on different scale: It is not a fair comparison if two elements are plotted side-by-side, on a different scale and compared. This makes one graph look better than the other, even when it is not. 4. Dual axis with different scales: If we are plotting two elements on the same graph with different scales, even if the axes are properly labeled, it is assumed that both axes are on the same scale. 5. Incomplete data: Short-term graphs are made to manipulate the trend, which will not be seen otherwise. Time-series data are cut intentionally to just show a trend within a particular period to create a more favorable visual impression.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> 8. Contemporary Research Results &amp; What’s Next</h2>
<p>Next Steps for Data Visualization Research</p>
<p>With the development, studies and new tools applied in data visualization, more people understand it matters. But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new approaches:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Adapting the Publication and Review Process As the article states, “both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reviews could serve as valuable guides”, so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for fledgling practitioners in the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting Discussion and Accretion Discussion of research papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the online forum.</p></li>
<li><p>Research Methods Training Developing a core curriculum for data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS faculty organized a new course on Designing Computer Science Experiments(<a href="http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/" class="uri">http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/</a>). Also, online resources could be reinforced with a catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided study to online courses. Useful examples include Jake Wobbrock’s Practical Statistics for HCI and Pierre Dragicevic’s resources for reforming statistical practice.</p></li>

<div id="typography-and-data-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Typography and Data Visualization</h2>
<p>This article discusses less common applications of typography in data visualization. While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, and other typographic elements in data visualization are less prevalent.</p>
<p>Highlighted in the article are preattentive visual attributes; preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of how many items are displayed. Therefore, “preattentive visual attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and are virtually unaffected by load.” Examples of preattentive attributes are size/area, hue, and curvature.</p>
<p>This brings us to the disparateness of the popularity of visual aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual attributes like size and hue. However, some typographic attributes such as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the two) are considered preattentive as well.<br />
Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data visualizations by technological advances.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general, the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small group of people rather than all of the data visualization design community. I would say that it is more likely that the use of typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias—if current visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken.<br />
However, the authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization, other spheres like typography, cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming “have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space.”</p>
<p>The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.<br />
Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>
<p>There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for data visualization in the article, not all of which I agree are made more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes, but the “Who Survived the Titanic” visualization’s use of typographic attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly, such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text replacement to indicate gender and the passengers’ names.</p>
<!-- ![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405872616300107-gr19.jpg)-->
<p>The authors round out the article by addressing the most common criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being whether or not text should even be considered an element of data visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more investment of attention to understand. Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that “this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type,” that while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of higher level patterns. Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying lengths representations of passengers’ names, and was corrected by only including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only vary so much.</p>
<p>All in all, this article has an interesting take on a somewhat less fashionable tool and puts forth the idea that text and typographic attributes can convey additional important information in data visualizations when used innovatively and correctly.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Balance: A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color, shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasis: Draw viewers attention towards important data by using key visual elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Movement: Ideally movement should mimic the way people usually read, starting at the top of the page, moving across it, and then down. Movement can also be created by using complimentary colors to pull the user’s attention across the page.</p></li>
<li><p>Pattern: Patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or for sets of data that equal in value. Disrupting the pattern can also be effective in drawing viewers attention; it naturally draws curiosity.</p></li>
<li><p>Repetition: Relationships between sets of data can be communicated by repeating chart types, shapes, or colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Proportion: If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going look bigger. In data visualization, proportion can indicate the importance of data sets, along with the actual relationship between numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Rhythm: A design has proper rhythm when the design elements create movement that is pleasing to the eye. If the design is not able to do so, rearranging visual elements may help.</p></li>
<li><p>Variety: Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be overlooked.</p></li>
<li><p>Unity: Unity across design will happen naturally if all other design principles are implemented.</p></li>
