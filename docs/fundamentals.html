<p>Storytelling is an essential part of data visualization. It is extremely important to effectively communicate information through the visualization. Stikeleather’s article <span class="citation">[@storytelling_with_data]</span> (2013) discussed the way in which a visual designer tells a story with a visualization.</p>

<td><strong>Find the compelling narrative</strong></td>
<td>Along with giving an account of the facts and establishing the connections between them, don’t be boring. You are competing for the viewer’s time and attention, so make sure the narrative has a hook, momentum, or a captivating purpose. Finding the narrative structure will help you decide whether you actually have a story to tell. If you don’t, then perhaps this visualization should support exploratory data analysis (EDA) rather than convey information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Think about the audience</strong></td>
<td>The visualization needs to be framed around the level of information the audience already has, correct and incorrect: Novice: first exposure to the subject, but doesn’t want oversimplification;Generalist: aware of the topic, but looking for an overview understanding and major themes; Managerial: in-depth, actionable understanding of intricacies and interrelationships with access to detail; Expert: more exploration and discovery and less storytelling with great detail;Executive: only has time to glean the significance and conclusions of weighted probabilities (e.g., novice, generalist, managerial, export, executive)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Be objective and offer balance</strong></td>
<td>A visualization should be devoid of bias. Even if it is arguing to influence, it should be based upon what the data says–not what you want it to say. There are simple ways to encourage objectivity: labeling to avoid ambiguity, have graphic dimensions match data dimensions, using standardized units, and keeping design elements from compromising the data. Balance can come from alternative representations (multiple clustering’s; confidence intervals instead of lines; changing timelines; alternative color palettes and assignments; variable scaling) of the data in the same visualization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Don’t censor</strong></td>
<td>Don’t be selective about the data you include or exclude, unless you’re confident you’re giving your audience the best representation of what the data “says”. This selectivity includes using discrete values when the data is continuous; how you deal with missing, outlier and out of range values; arbitrary temporal ranges; capped values, volumes, ranges, and intervals. Viewers will eventually figure that out and lose trust in the visualization (and any others you might produce).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Edit, Edit, Edit</strong></td>
<td>Take care to really try to explain the data, not just decorate it. Don’t fall into “it looks cool” trap, when it might not be the best way explain the data. As journalists and writers know, if you are spending more time editing and improving your visualization than creating it, you are probably doing something right.</td>

<p>Data visualization will not always unleash a ready-made story on its own. There are no rules, no protocol that will guarantee us a story. Instead, it makes more sense to look for <em>insights</em>, which can be artfully woven into stories in the hands of a good journalist <span class="citation">[@data_journ]</span><span class="citation">[@design_principles]</span><span class="citation">[@DataVizTips]</span><span class="citation">[@practitioners_guide]</span>.</p>
<p>Here is a process that may be followed for finding insights to tell a story.Each of these steps will be discussed further in this section.</p>

<div id="analyze-and-interpret" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Analyze and Interpret</h3>
<p>Once the data is visualized, the next step is to learn something from the visualization that is created. Questions that can be asked based on the picture can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can be seen in this image? Is it what that was expected?</li>
<li>Are there any interesting patterns?</li>
<li>What does this mean in the context of the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we might end up with visualization that, in spite of its beauty, might seem to tell that nothing of interest can be found from data. But there is almost always something that we can learn from any visualization, however trivial.</p>
</div>
<div id="document-your-insights-and-steps" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Document Your Insights and Steps</h3>
<p>If you think of this process as a journey through the dataset, the documentation is your travel diary. It will tell you where you have traveled to, what you have seen there and how you made your decisions for your next steps. You can even start your documentation before taking your first look at the data.</p>
<p>In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset, we are already full of expectations and assumptions about the data. Usually, there is a reason why we are interested in that dataset that we are looking at. It’s a good idea to start the documentation by writing down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and reduces the risk of misinterpretation of the data by just finding what we originally wanted to find.</p>
<p>I really think that the documentation is the most important step of the process, and it is also the one we’re most likely to tend to skip. As you will see in the example below, the described process involves a lot of plotting and data wrangling. Looking at a set of 15 charts you created might be very confusing, especially after some time has passed. In fact, those charts are only valuable (to you or any other person you want to communicate your findings) if presented in the context in which they have been created.</p>
<p>Hence, you should take the time to make some notes on things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why have I created this chart?</li>
<li>What have I done to the data to create it?</li>
<li>What does this chart tell me?</li>
</ul>
<div id="transform-data" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3.1</span> Transform Data</h4>
<p>Naturally, with the insights that you have gathered from the last visualization, you might have an idea of what you want to see next. You might have found some interesting pattern in the dataset which you now want to inspect in more detail. Possible transformations are the following.</p>

<p>Let’s consider the following example: You have visualized a graph and what came out of this was nothing but a mess of nodes connected through hundreds of edges (a very common result when visualizing so-called densely connected networks), one common transformation step would be to filter some of the edges. If, for instance, the edges represent money flows from donor countries to recipient countries we could remove all flows below a certain amount <span class="citation">[@DataVizBestPrac]</span>.</p>

<td><strong>Balance</strong></td>
<td>A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color, shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed. Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualization distributed evenly. And it is important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc. that can affect the balance of the display.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Emphasis</strong></td>
<td>Draw viewers’ attention towards important data by using key visual elements. Emphasis is the component that is most related to when reading the nine principles of design. It is the key to be conscious of what is drawing the viewers attention to the art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</td>

Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer’s experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally, images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.</td>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Tufte’s Principles of Design</h3>
<p>A graph should be impressive and can obtain audience’s attention. How can we achieve this? We must consider several aspects: <strong>efficiency, complexity, structure, density and beauty</strong>. We also should consider the audience whether they will be confused about the design.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Prin1ciple 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within reason</li>
</ol>
<p>Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. It is also the proportion of graphic’s ink devoted to the non-redundant display of data-information.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{Data \ Ink \ Ratio} = \frac{{Data \ Ink}}{{Total \ Ink}}\]</span></p>
<p>This basic idea is illustrated in the following visualizations.</p>
<p><strong>Erase non-data-ink and redundant data-ink.</strong> <img src="images/Tufte_figure1.png" /> (Source:<span class="citation">[@Tufte_2001]</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Erase non-data-ink and redundant data-ink.</strong> <img src="images/Tufte_figure2.png" /> (Source: <span class="citation">[@appli_2017]</span>)</p>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure3.png" /> (Source: <span class="citation">[@appli_2017]</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Always revise and edit</strong> <img src="images/Tufte_figure4.png" /> (Source: <span class="citation">[@Tufte_2001]</span>)</p>
<p>The graphs will be better for more information per unit of space and per unit of ink is displayed. Graphics are almost always going to improve as they go through editing, revision, and testing against different design options. Try to figure out whether the audience looking at the new designs be confused? Nothing is lost to those puzzled by the frame of dashes,and something is gained by those who do understand.</p>
<p>We can also assume that if you understand the statistical graphics, most other readers will, too because it is a frequent mistake in thinking about statistical graphics to underestimate the audience. Some of the new designs may appear odd, but this is probably because we have not seen them before.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Principle 2: Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The danger of multifunctioning elements is that they tend to generate graphical puzzles, with encodings that can only be broken by their inventor.Thus design techniques for enhancing graphical clarity in the face of complexity must be developed along with multifunctioning elements. In other words, we should try to make all present graphical elements data encoding elements. We must make every graphical element effective (See the following example).</p>
<p><img src="images/Tufte_figure6.png" /> (Source: <span class="citation">[@Tufte_2001]</span>)</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Principle 3: Maximize data density and the size of the data matrix, within reason.</li>
</ol>
<p>High preformation graphics should be designed with special care. As volume of data increases, data measures must shrink (smaller dots for scatters,thinner lines for busy time-series).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{Data \ Density} = \frac{{Entries \ in \ the \ Data \ Matrix}}{{Area \ of \ Chart}}\]</span></p>

<td><strong>Bokeh</strong></td>

Bokeh also supports streaming and real-time data.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Pygal</strong></td>
<td>Like Bokeh and Plotly, pygal offers interactive plots that can be embedded in the web browser. Its prime differentiator is the ability to output charts as SVGs. As long as you’re working with smaller datasets, SVGs will do you just fine. But if you’re making charts with hundreds of thousands of data points, they’ll have trouble rendering and SVG will become sluggish.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Plotly</strong></td>
<td>You might know Plotly as an online platform for data visualization, but did you also know you can access its capabilities from a Python notebook? Like Bokeh, Plotly’s forte is making interactive plots, but it offers some charts you won’t find in most libraries, like contour plots, dendograms, and 3D charts.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Geoplotlib</strong></td>
<td>geoplotlib is a toolbox for creating maps and plotting geographical data. You can use it to create a variety of map-types, like choropleths, heatmaps, and dot density maps. You must have Pyglet (an object-oriented programming interface) installed to use geoplotlib. Nonetheless, since most Python data visualization libraries don’t offer maps, it’s nice to have a library dedicated solely to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Gleam</strong></td>
<td>Gleam is inspired by R’s Shiny package. It allows you to turn analyses into interactive web apps using only Python scripts, so you don’t have to know any other languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Gleam works with any Python data visualization library. Once you’ve created a plot, you can build fields on top of it so users can filter and sort data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Missingno</strong></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Leather</strong></td>
<td>Leather’s creator, Christopher Groskopf, puts it best: “Leather is the Python charting library for those who need charts now and don’t care if they’re perfect.” It’s designed to work with all data types and produces charts as SVGs, so you can scale them without losing image quality. Since this library is relatively new, some of the documentation is still in progress. The charts you can make are pretty basic-but that’s the intention.</td>

<p>R Shiny enables us to produce interactive data visualizations with a minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Java using a simple web application framework that runs under the R statistical platform <span class="citation">[@shiny_interactive_viz]</span>. Standalone apps can be hosted on a webpage or embedded in R Markdown documents and dashboards can be built using R shiny. It combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. The main advantages of using R Shiny are : Its flexibility of pulling in whatever package in R that you want to solve your problem, reaping the benefits of an open source ecosystem for R and JavaScript visualization libraries, thereby allowing to create highly custom applications and enabling timely, high quality interactive data experience without (or with much less) web development and without the limitations or cost of proprietary BI tools.</p>

<div id="d3.js" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2.5</span> D3.js</h4>
<p>D3.js stands for Data-Driven Document, a JS library for interactive Big Data visualization in literally ANY way required real-time<span class="citation">[@d3_interactive_viz]</span>. This is not a tool, mind you, so a user should have a solid understanding of JavaScript to work with the data and present it in a humanly-understandable form. To say more, this library renders the data into SVG and HTML5 formats, so older browsers like IE7 and 8 cannot leverage D3.js capabilities.</p>
<p>The data gathered from disparate sources like huge-scale data sets is bind in real-time with DOM to produce interactive animations ( 2D and 3D alike) in an extremely rapid way. The D3 architecture allows the users to intensively reuse the codes across a variety of add-ons and plug-ins. Some of the key advantages are: It is dynamic, free and open source and very flexible with all web technologies, the ability to handle big data and the functional style allows to reuse the codes.</p>
<p><strong>The Hitchhiker’ Guide to d3.js</strong> is a wonderful guide for self-teaching d3.js. This guide is meant to prepare readers mentally as well as give readers some fruitful directions to pursue. There is a lot to learn besides the d3.js API, both technical knowledge around web standards like HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript as well as communication concepts and data visualization principles. Chances are you know something about some of those things, so this guide will attempt to give you good starting points for the things you want to learn more about.</p>
<p>It starts from the insights of learning d3.js by showing interviews with those top visualization practitioners. Then the author gives key concepts and useful features for learning visualization like d3-shape, d3 selection, d3-collection, ds-hierarchy, ds-zoom as well as d3-force.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this guide is it lists a lot of useful resources links for learning d3.js. For example, it recommends d3 API Reference, 2000+ d3 case studies and tutorials for d3. I did my exploratory analysis version of group project on d3. And I found this guide helpful during the progress. It also includes some meetup groups here in the bay area. So, maybe we can meet data friends through the group.</p>

<div id="typography-and-data-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Typography and Data Visualization</h2>
<p>This article discusses less common applications of typography in data visualization. While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, and other typographic elements in data visualization are less prevalent.</p>
<p>Highlighted in the article are preattentive visual attributes. Preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of how many items are displayed. Therefore, “preattentive visual attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and are virtually unaffected by load.” Examples of preattentive attributes are size/area, hue, and curvature.</p>
<p>This brings us to the disparate situation of the popularity of visual aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual attributes like size and hue.However, some typographic attributes such as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the two) are considered preattentive as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data visualizations by technological advances.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general, the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small group of people rather than all of the data visualization design community. I would say that it is more likely that the use of typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias if current visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken. However, the authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization, other spheres like typography, cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space?</p>
<p>The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>
<p>There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for data visualization in the article, not all of which I agree are made more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes, but the “Who Survived the Titanic” visualization’s use of typographic attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly, such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text replacement to indicate gender and the passengers names.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/TypographicTitanic.jpg" />

</div>
<p>The authors round out the article by addressing the most common criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being whether or not text should even be considered an element of data visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more investment of attention to understand. Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that “this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type? that while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of higher level patterns. Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying lengths representations of passengers’ names, and was corrected by only including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only vary so much.</p>

<p>Data visualization is also used across many different industries. One popular area right now is healthcare, especially involving big data. The benefits and uses of interactive data viz are detailed in a paper from the University of Maryland (2013). <span class="citation">[@data_viz_healthcare]</span></p>
<p><strong>The paper highlights three types of data that can and should be visualized to help in decision-making: personal, clinical, and public health information.</strong> Examples include: exploration of prescription patterns of different drugs and tracking personal health and fitness statistics. (Even the nice, clean Fitbit app home screen is a comprehensive dashboard!) Importantly, making sense of all this data collected from individuals will help healthcare organizations and companies provide more personalized and effective health treatment.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> How visualization impacts Industry/business</h3>
<p><span class="citation">[@biz_strategy]</span> According to an Experian report, 95% of U.S. organizations say that they use data to power business opportunities, and another 84 percent believe data is an integral part of forming a business strategy. Visualization helps data impact business in following ways:</p>
<div id="cleaning" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2.1</span> Cleaning</h4>
<p>The simplest way to explain the importance of visualization is to look at visualization as the means to making sense of data. Even the most basic, widely-used data visualization tools that combine simple pie charts and bar graphs help people comprehend large amounts of information fast and easily, compared to paper reports and spreadsheets. In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare quality assets to derive valuable insights.</p>
<p>Cleaning the data is usually the first step in data processing and is done to remove the unwanted elements as well as to reduce the size of the data sets, which will make it easier for the algorithms to analyze it. Data cleansing is typically done by using instance reduction techniques.</p>
<p>Instance reduction helps reduce the size of the data set without compromising the quality of insights that can be extracted from the data. It removes instances and generates new ones to make the data set compact. There are two major instance reduction algorithms:</p>
<p>Instance selection: Instance selection is used to identify the best examples from a very large data set with many instances in order to curate them as the input for the analytics system. It aims to select a subset of the data that can act as a replacement for the original data set while completely fulfilling the goal. It will also remove redundant instances and noise.</p>
<p>Instance generation: Instance generation methods involve replacing the original data with artificially generated data in order to fill regions in the domain of an issue with no representative examples in the master data. A common approach is to relabel examples that appear to belong to wrong class labels. Instance generation thus makes the data clean and ready for the analysis algorithm.</p>

<div id="extracting" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2.2</span> Extracting</h4>
<p>Known versatile tools for data visualization and analytics Elastic Stack, Tableau, Highcharts, and more complex database solutions like Hadoop, Amazon AWS and Teradata, have wide applications in business, from monitoring performance to improving customer experience on mobile tools. New generation of data visualization based on AR and VR technology, however, provides formerly unfeasible advantages in terms of identifying patterns and drawing insights from various data streams.</p>
<p>Building 3D data visualization spaces, companies can create an intuitive environment that helps data scientists grasp and analyze more data streams at the same time, observe data points from multiple dimensions, identify previously unavailable dependencies and manipulate data by naturally moving objects, zooming, and focusing on more granulated areas. Moreover, these tools allow us to expand the capabilities of data visualization by creating collaborative 3D environments for teams. As a result, new technology helps extract more valuable insights from the same volume of data.</p>
<p>Data has shown phenomenal growth over the past decade and it’s widespread application by businesses as a growth catalyst continues to deliver positive results. The scale of data is massive and the volume, velocity and variety of data calls for more efficient processing to make it machine-ready. Although there are a multitude of ways to extract data such as public APIs, custom web scraping services, internal data sources, etc., there would always remain the need to do some pre-processing to make the data perfectly suitable for business applications. Data pre-processing techniques like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data cleansing</li>
<li>Data Manipulation</li>
<li>Data normalization</li>
<li>Data Transformation</li>
<li>Missing values imputation</li>
<li>Noise identification</li>
<li>Minimizing the pre-processing tasks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>play a key role in the process.</strong></p>

<div id="strategizing" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2.3</span> Strategizing</h4>
<p>As the amount of data grows, it becomes harder to catch up with it. Therefore, data strategy becomes the necessary part of the success in applying data to businesses. Then how data visualization become an important tool in your strategic kit?</p>
<p>First, it helps you cleanse your data. Secondly, it allows you to identify and extract meaningful information from it. Finally, data visualization tools enable continuous real-time monitoring of how your strategy and now data-driven decisions influence performance and business outcomes. In other words, these tools visualize not only the data, but also the results, and help correct and optimize strategy on the go.</p>
<p>Data visualization is one of the initial and most important steps made to derive value from data. It determines how efficiently analysts can work with data assets, what insights they are able to extract and how their data strategy will develop over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the quality and capabilities of data visualization directly influence how data impacts your business strategy and what benefits data applications can bring to the companies and their industries.</p>
