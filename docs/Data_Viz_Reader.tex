\chapter{Preface}\label{preface}

This is a collaborative writing project as part of the course MSIS 2629
``Data Visualization'' at \href{http://www.scu.edu}{Santa Clara
University}. The purpose of the class reader is to collaboratively
engage with and reflect on data visualizations, to establish a solid
theoretical background, and to collect useful practices and showcases.
More information on the background of this project is available in the
\href{https://mschermann.github.io/msis2629spring2018}{syllabus}.

The following text serves explains how we organize ourselves.

\section{References}\label{references}

\textbf{EVERY} references must be included in the \texttt{book.bib}
file. This file uses the BibTeX notation (Learn how to use BibTeX
\href{http://www.bibtex.org/Using/}{here}.). Most literature search
engines allow you to export the reference information in BibTeX. For
websites we use the following minimal notation (you may add further
information - usually the more the better is a good strategy):

\begin{verbatim}
@misc{great_viz,
  author = {{A great visualizer}},
  year = {1982},
  title = {A ficticious web page title},
  howpublished = {\url{http://great_viz_org/}},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
\end{verbatim}

Particularly important is the \texttt{note} field. Websites change
frequently, so links will break. If we do this correctly,
\texttt{{[}@great\_viz{]}} will produce \citep{great_viz}.

\section{Images}\label{images}

Images should not be loaded from external website because the links may
change. Instead download a version of the image and create a reference
that contains the link to the image. For example the following image is
a deceptive visualization (the bars do start at zero).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/halper_welfare.jpg}
\caption{An Example of a deceptive visualization}
\end{figure}

Source: \citep{halper_2012} referenced in \citep{andale_2014}

The citation for the image looks like this.

\begin{verbatim}
@misc{halper_2012,
  author={Halper, Daniel},
  year={2012},
  title = {Over 100 Million Now Receiving Federal Welfare},
  url={https://www.weeklystandard.com/daniel-halper/over-100-million-now-receiving-federal-welfare},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
\end{verbatim}

You have probably found this image through a different website that
explains the visualization. For example the following website explains
some problematic aspects of this visualization:

\begin{verbatim}
@misc{andale_2014,
  author={Andalde, Stephanie},
  year={2014},
  title = {Misleading Graphs: Real Life Examples},
  url={http://www.statisticshowto.com/misleading-graphs/},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{table} environments, respectively.--\textgreater{}

was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015}.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{What is Data Visualization?}\label{what-is-data-visualization}

\textbf{Data visualization} refers to representing data in a visual
context to help people understand the significance of that data. A way
so that information, numbers, and measurements makes sense is a form of
art -- the art of data visualization. Graphs do that for us. According
to Friedman (2008) \citep{viz} the ``main goal of data visualization is
to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical
means. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to
be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey
ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand
in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by
communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way.''

\textbf{Information visualization}, the art of representing data in a
way that it is easy to understand and to manipulate, can help us make
sense of information and thus make it useful in our lives. From business
decision making to simple route navigation -- there's a huge (and
growing) need for data to be presented so that it delivers value.

This article is a brief introduction to information visualization. It
explains briefly how information visualization helps to make sense of
data, how it helps to find relationships between data and confirm ideas.
Some examples and common uses of information visualization is discussed
below \citep{info_viz}.

\section{Why is Data Visualization
Important?}\label{why-is-data-visualization-important}

Today more than ever, data visualization represents a simple,
user-friendly approach to understand data and make business decisions
quickly. Here are some articles on why it is important today.

\subsection{Chris Pittenturf's article on the importance of data
visualization to
businesses}\label{chris-pittenturfs-article-on-the-importance-of-data-visualization-to-businesses}

The article \citep{viz_importance}, written by Chris Pittenturf, VP-Data
\& Analytics, Palace Sports \& Entertainment, talks about what data
visualization is and its importance to the businesses today.

The article begins with a definition of data visualization in simple
terms and goes on to explain how a good data visualization should be
visually engaging to the reader. Chris goes on to explain the basic
criteria that a data visualization should satisfy to be an effective
visualization. These criteria and their brief meanings are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Informative: The visualization should be able to convey the
  information of the data to the reader
\item
  Efficient: The visualization should not be ambiguous.
\item
  Appealing: The visualization should be captivating and visually
  pleasing.
\item
  (Optional) Interactive and Predictive: The visualizations can contain
  variables and filters for the users to interact with the
  visualizations in order to predict results of different scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

Pittenturf goes on to give various day-to-day examples where
visualization gives a better understanding of the data. One extremely
simple example used by Pittenturf is that of an energy bill. Pittenturf
states that as a consumer, when we receive an energy bill, we normally
look at the graph in the bill first before proceeding to read the text
in the bill. Pittenturf states that consumers are more likely to analyze
and understand the visualizations before reading further along. The
article ends with Pittenturf emphasizing the importance of data
visualizations in our businesses as well as in our daily lives.It gives
a simple, short and crisp understanding of what data visualization is
and how it is relevant to everyone. Data visualization is an aid to get
a better understanding of the complex insights that any business data
provides. Most of the data used by the businesses is highly unstructured
and these businesses can get a better understanding of their businesses
by visualizing their data.

\subsection{David McCandless's TED talk on data
visualization}\label{david-mccandlesss-ted-talk-on-data-visualization}

Visuals help us understand concepts that would otherwise be difficult to
contextualize---for example, expenditures or valuations of extremely
large amounts of money are represented in the billion dollar-o-gram by
color-coded, relatively-sized boxes. Furthermore, it allows synthesis of
a breadth of information to be delivered in a small, easily-digestible,
aesthetically pleasing way. Visuals serve as a sort of map for a vast
landscape of information---they direct your eyes to the important places
and details. And the eye, as McCandless notes, is uniquely suited among
our senses to process large amounts of information and detect patterns.
The billion dollar-o-gram is extremely readable and rather pretty, but
it seems a bit dubious to compare the predicted Iraq War cost to the
``mushroomed'' actual cost of Iraq and Afghanistan wars, since its
purpose seems only to conflate two wars for dramatic effect
\citep{viz_ted}.

Beyond its ability to make information from several different sources
and in large amounts more quickly and easily understood, data
visualization can also reveal smaller interesting patterns---allowing us
to play the ``data detective'' as McCandless calls it. In other words,
as we have already discussed, data visualization can not only be
extremely effective in a declarative manner, but can also be used as an
exploratory tool \citep{viz_ted}.

McCandless also postulates that we all have a latent ``design literacy''
that is being developed every day as we are constantly bombarded with
visuals, and that our minds and our eyes are taking in this information
and processing it so that we all have an intuitive sense of design, and
have actually begun to demand a visual aspect to our information. This
is an interesting perspective, since everyone does seem to have a sense
of visual aspects---space, color, etc., but of course the time-honored
adage tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So while it
might be whimsical to claim that we are all designers, there is still,
of course, great value in learning formal principles of design
\citep{viz_ted}.

\section{Key Figures in the History of Data
Visualization}\label{key-figures-in-the-history-of-data-visualization}

The history of data visualization is full of incredible stories marked
by major events, led by a few key players. This article introduces some
of the amazing men and women who paved the way by combining art,
science, and statistics.And one of them is Charles Joseph Minard, whose
most famous work is the map of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812
displayed in our class. Below we have some figures names with their
famous works, and you can find other stories in the article
\citep{history_viz}.

\subsection{William Playfair
(1759--1823)}\label{william-playfair-17591823}

William Playfair is considered the father of statistical graphics,
having invented the line and bar chart we use so often today. He is also
credited with having created the area and pie chart. Playfair was a
Scottish engineer and political economist who published The Commercial
and Political Atlas in 1786. This book featured a variety of graphs
including the image below. In this famous example, he compares exports
from England with imports into England from Denmark and Norway from 1700
to 1780.

\begin{figure}

\caption{}
\end{figure}

\subsection{John Snow (1813--1858)}\label{john-snow-18131858}

In 1854, a cholera epidemic spread quickly through Soho in London. The
Broad Street area had seen over 600 dead, and the remaining residents
and business owners had largely fled the terrible disease. Physician
John Snow plotted the locations of cholera deaths on a map. The
surviving maps of his work show a method of tallying the death counts,
drawn as lines parallel to the street, at the appropriate addresses.
Snow's research revealed a pattern. He saw a clear concentration around
the water pump on Broad Street, helping to find the cause of the
infection.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Charles Joseph Minard
(1781--1870)}\label{charles-joseph-minard-17811870}

Charles Joseph Minard was a French civil engineer famous for his
representation of numerical data on maps. His most famous work is the
map of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812 displaying the dramatic loss
of his army over the advance on Moscow and the following retreat. You
can see how many soldiers are still marching and how many died. Drawn in
1869, it is described by many as the best statistical graphic ever
drawn. It represents the earliest beginnings of data journalism.

\section{A Brief History of Data
Visualization}\label{a-brief-history-of-data-visualization}

\begin{quote}
``The only new thing in the world is the history you don't know.'' ---
Harry S Truman
\end{quote}

This paper provides an overview of the intellectual history of data
visualization from medieval to modern times, it describes and
illustrates some significant advances along the way. It is common to
think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively
modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation
of quantitative information has deep roots.These roots reach into the
histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later
into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics,
medicine, and other fields. Developments in technologies (printing,
reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical
observation and recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new
advances in form and content \citep{data_viz_history}.

Data visualization has comes a long way. Prior to the 17th century, data
visualization already exists. Though display in other format such as
maps, the content are much similar to today's visualization, which
mostly presented geologic, economic, and medical data. The earliest
seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the
positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps
to aid in navigation and exploration.\strut

By the mid-1800s, all the conditions for the rapid growth of
visualization had been established a ``perfect storm'' for data
graphics. Official state statistical offices were established throughout
Europe, in recognition of the growing importance of numerical
information for social planning,industrialization, commerce, and
transportation.\strut

If the late 1800s were the ``golden age'' of statistical graphics and
thematic cartography, the early 1900s can be called the ``modern dark
ages'' of visualization. There were few graphical innovations, and, by
the mid-1930s, the enthusiasm for visualization which characterized the
late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of quantification and formal,
often statistical, models in the social sciences.\strut

\section{Practitioners Guide to Best Practices in Data
Visualization}\label{practitioners-guide-to-best-practices-in-data-visualization}

These are the best practices of data visualization
\citep{best-practice}. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the
viewers will ask and then focus your visualization with respect to those
questions. Brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what
is important in 2 ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  unconscious (System 1 represents uncontrolled functions such as facial
  expressions, reactions) and
\item
  conscious (System 2 represents controlled function such as solving
  math problems).
\end{itemize}

Data Visualization leverage attributes of System 1, which has can have
quick and correct impact in a most efficient manner.

Three best practices of data visualization are as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Phase}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Design and layout matter\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey
your message to the viewer.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Avoid Clutter\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink
ratio, the ratio of ink required to convey the intended meaning to the
total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1
as possible. That means, avoid ink which do not add any
information.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Use color purposely and effectively\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distracting too.
Thus, color should be used only if it assist in conveying your message.
The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios
and examples which helps to comprehend the topic in more meaningful and
practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using
the above principles.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

And the above best practices could be applied to all the three types of
analytics: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.

\subsection{Three Rules to Follow in order to Develop Intuitive
Dashboards:}\label{three-rules-to-follow-in-order-to-develop-intuitive-dashboards}

Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual
that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be
appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead
to effective presentation of the data \citep{intuitive-dash}.

\textbf{1. The dashboard should read left to right} Because we read from
top to bottom and left to right, a reader's eyes will naturally look in
the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words
in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of
the page does not always have to be the most important. Annual data is
usually more important to a business but daily or weekly data could be
used more often for day to day work. This should be kept in mind when
designing a dashboard as dashboards are often used as a quick convenient
way to look up data.

\textbf{2. Group related information together} Grouping related data
together is an intuitive way to help the flow of the visual. It does not
make sense for a user to have to search in different areas to find the
information they need.

\textbf{3. Find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and
display visuals together to show the relationship.} Grouping unrelated
data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the important thing is
to tell a story not previously observed. Data analytics is all about
finding stories the data are trying to tell. Once they are discovered,
the stories need to be presented in an effective manner. Grouping
unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they change together.

\section{Fundamental Components of
Design}\label{fundamental-components-of-design}

Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition,
proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity as the design foundation of any
work. If you want to take your data visualization from an everyday
dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the following nine
principles of design from graphic designer Melissa Anderson
\citep{design_principles}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Criteria}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Balance\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color,
shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Emphasis\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Draw viewers attention towards important data by using key visual
elements.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Movement\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Ideally movement should mimic the way people usually read, starting at
the top of the page, moving across it, and then down. Movement can also
be created by using complimentary colors to pull the user's attention
across the page.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Pattern\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or for
sets of data that equal in value. Disrupting the pattern can also be
effective in drawing viewers attention; it naturally draws
curiosity.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Repetition\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Relationships between sets of data can be communicated by repeating
chart types, shapes, or colors.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Proportion\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going look
bigger. In data visualization, proportion can indicate the importance of
data sets, along with the actual relationship between numbers.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Rhythm\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A design has proper rhythm when the design elements create movement that
is pleasing to the eye. If the design is not able to do so, rearranging
visual elements may help.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Variety\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged
with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by
the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be
overlooked.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Unity\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Unity across design will happen naturally if all other design principles
are implemented.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Balance doesn't mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect
symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the
dashboard/visualization distributed evenly. And it is important to
remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc.
that can affect the balance of the display. Another closely related
component to balance is variety, which could seem counter to balance,
but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of
information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered
and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.
Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion
can be subtle but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer's
experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion
though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously.
Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive
the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the
scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they
write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to
interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we
take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and
remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.
Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through
the nine principles of design in this article. From prior experience
with art through photography, I understand it is the key to be conscious
of what I am drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking
about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to
remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire
visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or
how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.

\subsection{Visualization and Graphics Principles to Refocus and Guide
You}\label{visualization-and-graphics-principles-to-refocus-and-guide-you}

Jonathon Corum is a graphics designer for The New York Times and he
provided a very informative talk to a strictly scientific audience on
how to create and design visualizations that explain material originally
created for a certain audience, i.e.~the scientific community, but now
is to be related to a different audience, (in his case, the readership
of the Times or maybe the public at large). The talk is filled with
examples and break downs of how he has moved from his base content to
the final product, all of which are illuminating examples by themselves.
There is also great power in the broader themes that he is trying to
convey.

First, of course is knowing the audience that you are producing the work
for, but even in this step, do not lose sight of the ultimate goal of
conveying understanding, of explaining a concept. You are searching for
a visual idea in your content that can be communicated to your audience.
Some of the main highlights to help you make this connection with your
audience involve:

\textbf{Focusing the attention:} What can be removed? Realize that
consistency can help eliminate unnecessary distractions. There may be a
trade off between losing information but conveying the ultimate meaning
more clearly. Label important things rather than relying on a legend,
which requires the viewer to hold on to too much information at once.

\textbf{Involving your audience:} Give them opportunities to connect
their own general knowledge on the topic. Use real world comparisons or
examples to help build and relate context. Encourage comparisons and
make this easy for the viewer to process and see.

\textbf{Explaining why:} Providing context, adding time sequence
details, showing movement, change and mechanism will all guide your
audience in connecting the dots and understanding the significance of
what you are trying to communicate.

\section{Data Visualization Tools}\label{data-visualization-tools}

Due to the rise of big data analytics, there has been an increased need
for data visualization tools to help understand the data. Besides
Tableau, there are several other software tools one can use for data
visualization like Sisense, Plotly, FusionCharts, Highcharts,
Datawrapper, and Qlikview. This article is from Forbes and has a brief,
clear introduction about these 7 powerful software options for data
visualization. This could be helpful for future reference because for
different purposes I may need to use different tools. Each option has
its advantages and disadvantages and this article helps highlight them.

\section{What I learned recreating one chart using 24
tools}\label{what-i-learned-recreating-one-chart-using-24-tools}

Lisa Rost's article ``What I learned recreating one chart using 24
tools'' describes lessons learned from recreating one chart using many
different data visualization tools \citep{different_tools}. The author
used apps Excel, Plotly, Easycharts, Google Sheets, Lyra, Highcharts,
Tableau, Polestar, Quadrigram, Illustrator, RAW, and NodeBox, as well as
charting libraries ggvis, Bokeh, Highcharts, ggplot2, Processing, NVD3,
Seaborn, Vega, D3, matplotlib, Vega-Lite, and R. She links her github
page on the project which details the data set she used, containing the
health expectancy in years as well as GDP per capita and population for
about 200 countries in the year 2015, as well has her process and
results of visualizing the data using each tool. However, in the
article, she focuses on the main takeaways from the exercise, which was
especially interesting in the context of our class discussion on
different types of tools and their respective strengths. She also
provides her own graphics to help illustrate her lessons learned.

Takeaway 1: \textbf{``There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for
People with Certain Goals''} Since data visualization is necessary in
many spheres, from science to journalism, data visualization projects
will often have quite disparate objectives, and the people working on
them will have different requirements. And as the author aptly points
out, it is impossible for one tool to satisfy the needs of every data
visualizer; so there will necessarily be tools better suited to specific
situations. For example, does the user need a tool for exploratory
visualization of the data, or does the user seek to create graphs and
charts to show the public or a specific audience something?

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/analysis_spectrum.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The author also notes that the flexibility of a tool is a sticking point
as well---if you need to change your data while developing a data
visualization, certain apps like Illustrator will not be ideal because
changing the data even slightly requires you to build the graph again
from scratch. Another thing to think about is the type of chart you are
trying to create---is a basic, canned bar or line graph all you need (in
which case something like Excel will do the trick), or does your project
necessitate a more innovative or custom chart (like something possible
in D3.js)? Interactivity is another big question---only certain tools
will make this possible.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/interactivity.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Takeaway 2: \textbf{``There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for
People with Certain Mindsets''}

This section of the article is all about the difference in people's
preferences and opinions; from the people who build the tools to the
users, everyone thinks differently. Therefore, certain tools will be
inherently more intuitive to use for different people.

Takeaway 3: \textbf{`` We Still Live in an `Apps Are for the Easy Stuff,
Code Is for the Good Stuff in the World''} Basically, writing code can
be scary for anyone without a coding background, but it provides more
flexibility, and, as mentioned in class, code is perfectly reproducible.
On the other hand, apps are much more user-friendly for the less
computer science-savvy.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/apps_vs_code.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Takeaway 4: \textbf{``\,`Every Tool Forces You Down a Path'\,''}

Rost quotes her former NPR Visuals teammate for the final lesson header,
pointing out that tools themselves influence the development of a data
visualization with their respective features, strengths, and
limitations.

\subsection{Definions of Data Deception and Graphic
Integrity}\label{definions-of-data-deception-and-graphic-integrity}

Data visualization is becoming more and more popular to communicate and
support arguments nowadays. There are lots of great resources online to
create and design amazing data products, but at the same time, there are
some poorly-designed, misleading deceptive, data visualizations. Data
visualization is a powerful communication tool to support arguments with
numbers in a way that is accessible and engaging. More people than ever
before are making their own charts and infographics, which is presenting
a unique problem. Despite the availability of some great charting
resources, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed misleading or
downright deceptive data visualizations
\citep{decept_study},\citep{rose_tint}.

So what does \textbf{data deception} mean? Data deception, defined by
School of Law at the New York University, as ``a graphical depiction of
information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may
create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies
from the actual message.''

Edward Tufte already introduced the concept of graphical integrity in
his book and presented six principles of graphic integrity. Here are the
principles from book:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface
  of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the
  numerical quantities measured.
\item
  Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat
  graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data
  on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.
\item
  In time-series displays of money, deﬂated and standardized units of
  monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.
\item
  The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted
  should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.
\item
  Show data variation, not design variation.
\item
  Graphics must not quote data out of context.
\end{itemize}

Deceptive, misleading, or distorted graphs are graphs created which
skews the data, intentionally or unintentionally, resulting in a
representation of incorrect conclusions.

There are some ways in which distorted graphs can be created
\citep{evil_axes},\citep{mislead_graph_ex}:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Improper scaling of y axis}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
This is one of the classic misleading graphs. Instead of scale starting
from zero or a baseline, y axis is scaled conveniently to highlight the
differences among bins.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Improper labelling of graphs}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Lack of labels make the graph hard to interpret for the reader and lead
to wrong conclusions.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Paired graphs on different scale}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
It is not a fair comparison if two elements are plotted side-by-side, on
a different scale and compared. This makes one graph look better than
the other, even when it is not.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Dual axis with different scales}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
If we are plotting two elements on the same graph with different scales,
even if the axes are properly labeled, it is assumed that both axes are
on the same scale.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Incomplete data}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Short-term graphs are made to manipulate the trend, which will not be
seen otherwise. Time-series data are cut intentionally to just show a
trend within a particular period to create a more favorable visual
impression.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\citep{visual-lies} focuses on a few methods that data visualizers
utilize to mislead users about research findings. For each method, the
author has highlighted the signifiers that are manipulated to promote an
unrealistic understanding of the visualized data. The author has
concentrated on examples of three areas to create deceptive data
visualization: size, segmentation, and graph type.

** Size ** Size signifies quantity, volume or degree of variables within
a data. In first figure the y-axis from the graph to the right is cut
when transcribed onto the graph on the left. Here both the graphs show
the same data but the one on the left represents the data in a
misleading fashion because of the way the axis is cut, and the result is
that interest rates have increased drastically from 2008 to 2012 -- a
misinterpretation that is avoided in the graph on the right.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Size1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

** Quantity ** Quantity is the measure of size. When depicting points on
a scatter plot, the author suggest that it is helpful to manipulate the
size the points to represent differing values of a variable that is not
represented on the x and y axes. Following graph shows quantity as a two
completely different measure. One chart uses quantity as Area and other
uses it as radius. The result is that the differences in quantity
between points on such a scatter plot would appear more dramatic than
they should be.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Quantity1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

** Segmentation ** Figure shows an example of this with a deceptive
instance of binning given in the legend on the left. Segmentation can be
used to show category, parts, domains or ranges within a chart. The
author states that correct use of segmentation can enable users to
enhance understanding and if used incorrectly can be deceptive. It is
shown here binning is different in both and since in the left figure
binning is not done appropriately it is difficult to come up with actual
values of the data.

Figure 3: \includegraphics{images/Segmentation 1.png}

** Graph ** Two graphs that are most often misrepresented are pie-charts
and maps. The author explains that in the following figure Pie charts
can't be compared accurately to one another. When striving for an
accurate portrayal of values, they should be avoided. The author further
states that it would be difficult to understand the pie-charts had the
numbers were not't given.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/PieCharts.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The author then states that when showing spatial data analysis always
show population density when visualizing values that are
person-dependent. On a heat map where color signifies quantity, The
author suggests that a user will be drawn to the colors that a legend
indicates are most extreme.

In following figure, areas that are darkest are simply the most
population-dense regions of the United States. Without accounting for
population density, the newly created map may look the same as hundreds
of maps bearing a striking resemblance to the figure, which are falsely
considered informative and are regularly shared across social media
sites.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Maps1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The above pointers are very helpful when analyzing a deceptive version
of a data product. However, as data visualizers we carefully need to
draw the line between creating misleading graphs that tells a different
story and deceptive version which is meant for exaggeration. The above
can be applied in our projects and can also be used to enhance our
understanding of great data visualization product.

Misleading graphs are sometimes deliberately misleading and sometimes
it's just a case of people not understanding the data behind the graph
they create \citep{andale_2014}. But some real life misleading graphs go
above and beyond the classic types. Some are intended to mislead, others
are intended to shock. The ``classic'' types of misleading graphs
include cases where:

\textbf{The Missing Baseline} For example, the Vertical scale is too big
or too small, or skips numbers, or does not't start at zero, like the
graph below: You might be thinking that the graph on the right shows The
Times makes double the sales of The Daily Telegraph. But take a closer
look at the scale and you'll see although The Times does make more
sales, it's only beating the competition by about 10\%.

\textbf{The graph isn't labeled properly.} Graphs can have the correct
figures, but still can mislead you. This one used a BIG HEADLINE makes
you think that 5.3\% of children get spinal cord injuries which is a
pretty scary statistic for parents. But the real figure is about
.0000003\% (based on 2000 injuries per year out of a population of
around 74,000,000). And for the figure 1 used in this article:
Misleading Graphs: Displaying a Change in One Variable Using Area or
Volume \citep{scaling_issues}, the label for the smaller triangle in
this graph says \$26.4 while the label for the larger triangle says
\$114.6. \$114.6 is 4.34 times \$26.4. It certainly looks to me as if
more than 4.34 smaller triangles will fit in the larger triangle. It is
the altitudes of the triangles that are proportional to the numbers in
the labels.

\textbf{Data is left out} Only includes part of the data like the
following graph which uses temperatures of the first half of the year to
prove it was rising dramatically. For more examples and inspirations on
misleading graphs or deceptive graphs refer the following articles :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bar charts without zero \& evenly spaced tick marks for uneven
  intervals: \citep{whats_wrong}
\item
  Graphs not drawn to scale:\citep{scaling_issues}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Treating correlation as causation.} Even if the labels and data
in your graph is correct, it does not mean that the conclusion is
logically correct. A correlation between X and Y does not automatically
indicate that the change in one variable is caused by the change in the
values of the other one, whereas the causation means that one event is
the result of the occurrence of the other event. From the graph, we
should bear in mind that it only presents the correlation between ice
cream sold and murders, rather than causation.

\end{figure}

Another trick of misleading graph is axis change: Changing thy y-axis
maximum affect how the graph look like. A higher maximum will make the
graph to appear less volatile ,less steep than a lower maximum. The
other way of axis change is changing the ratio of a graph's dimensions.
This way will affect how the graph appears. We demonstrate changing the
ratio of graph dimension for below graphs.

\end{figure}

It is not technically wrong but it is definitely misleading.This is
often called improper extraction or tactic omitting data, when only a
certain chunk of data is included.This is more common in graphs that
have time as one of their axis. Here is the graph to show what it is.

In the data visualization terms, we call it truncated graph. A truncated
graph (also known as a torn graph) has a y axis that does not start at
0. These graphs can create the impression of important change where
there is relatively little change.Truncated graphs are useful in
illustrating small differences.{[}16{]} Graphs may also be truncated to
save space. Commercial software such as MS Excel will tend to truncate
graphs by default if the values are all within a narrow range.
Truncating graphs make the readers to change their judgement for
something that is not significant looks like a huge difference.

A example of using good data in a misleading graph to fool readers comes
from Fox News. \includegraphics{images/1.png}

\section{Data Visualization in
Business}\label{data-visualization-in-business}

\citep{biz_strategy} According to an Experian report, 95\% of U.S.
organizations say that they use data to power business opportunities,
and another 84 percent believe data is an integral part of forming a
business strategy. Visualization helps data impact business in following
ways:

\textbf{1. Cleaning}

The simplest way to explain the importance of visualization is to look
at visualization as the means to making sense of data. Even the most
basic, widely-used data visualization tools that combine simple pie
charts and bar graphs help people comprehend large amounts of
information fast and easily, compared to paper reports and spreadsheets.

In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of
data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools
perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and
create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become
indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare
quality assets to derive valuable insights.

\textbf{2. Extracting}

Known versatile tools for data visualization and analytics -- Elastic
Stack, Tableau, Highcharts, and more complex database solutions like
Hadoop, Amazon AWS and Teradata, have wide applications in business,
from monitoring performance to improving customer experience on mobile
tools. New generation of data visualization based on AR and VR
technology, however, provides formerly unfeasible advantages in terms of
identifying patterns and drawing insights from various data streams.

Building 3D data visualization spaces, companies can create an intuitive
environment that helps data scientists grasp and analyze more data
streams at the same time, observe data points from multiple dimensions,
identify previously unavailable dependencies and manipulate data by
naturally moving objects, zooming, and focusing on more granulated
areas. Moreover, these tools allow us to expand the capabilities of data
visualization by creating collaborative 3D environments for teams. As a
result, new technology helps extract more valuable insights from the
same volume of data.

\textbf{3. Strategizing}

As the amount of data grows, it becomes harder to catch up with it.
Therefore, data strategy becomes the necessary part of the success in
applying data to business. Then how data visualization become an
important tool in your strategic kit? First, it helps you cleanse your
data. Secondly, it allows you to identify and extract meaningful
information from it. Finally, data visualization tools enable continuous
real-time monitoring of how your strategy and now data-driven decisions
influence performance and business outcomes. In other words, these tools
visualize not only the data, but also the results, and help correct and
optimize strategy on the go.

Data visualization is one of the initial steps made to derive value from
data. It's also one of the most important steps, as it determines how
efficiently analysts can work with data assets, what insights they are
able to extract and how their data strategy will develop over time.

Therefore, the quality and capabilities of data visualization directly
influence how data impacts your business strategy and what benefits data
applications can bring to the companies and their industries.\_

\section{Pick the Right Chart Type}\label{pick-the-right-chart-type}

Data visualization is a combination of art and science. When it comes to
the artistic aspect, there are no correct answers for doing the
visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, when
making sense of facts, numbers, and measurement, better understanding is
promoted by a logical path to follow. To determine the best type of
chart is hard for those new to data visualization. Most people learn it
by referring to other people's work without understanding the underlying
logic, so they don't have the theory in their mind to make the
judgement.

When we are choosing the type of chart, we need to answer some
questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How many features would you like to show in a chart?
\item
  How many data points do you want to display for each variable?
\item
  Will you display time serious data or among items or groups.
\end{itemize}

After answered this question, you should able to get a better
imagination of your ideal graph. The simple guidance for using different
type of chart is line charts for tracking trends over time, bar charts
to compare quantities, scatter plots for joint variation of two data
items, bubble charts showing joint variation of three data items, and
pie charts to compare parts of a whole.

Let's review the most commonly used chart types and explain what
circumstance should better use typical chart and the pros and cons of
each type of chart. Before introduce different types of charts, you can
use the following website to familiar with different types of charts
\citep{charts_viz}.

\textbf{Type 1 Column Charts.} This should be the most popular chart
type. This chart is good to do comparison between different values when
specific values are important. TBD

Still have hard time to choose? There are many resources on line can
help you do the decision. For example, Dr.~Andre Abela create a chart
selection diagram that is helpful to pick the right chart depends on the
data type. The link of website is

\subsection{Typography and Data
Visualization}\label{typography-and-data-visualization}

This article discusses less common applications of typography in data
visualization. While data components such as quantitative or categorical
data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or
shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, and other typographic
elements in data visualization are less prevalent.

Highlighted in the article are preattentive visual attributes;
preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have
determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of
how many items are displayed. Therefore, ``preattentive visual
attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand
attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and
are virtually unaffected by load.'' Examples of preattentive attributes
are size/area, hue, and curvature.

This brings us to the disparate situation of the popularity of visual
aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font
variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible
reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual
attributes like size and hue.However, some typographic attributes such
as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the
two) are considered preattentive as well.

Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally
powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming
languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of
typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as
serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data
visualizations by technological advances.

Lastly, the authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of
typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited
knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data
visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the
first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with
technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general,
the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data
visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small
group of people rather than all of the data visualization design
community. I would say that it is more likely that the use of
typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there
are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status
quo bias---if current visual attributes are received well, the
prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken. However, the
authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes
in data visualization, other spheres like typography, cartography,
mathematics, chemistry, and programming ``have a rich history with type
and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space.''

The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic
attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may
be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and
intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and
font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.

Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic
attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the
ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that
identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and
blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only
improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues
by providing a means to zoom in on small text.

There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for
data visualization in the article, not all of which I agree are made
more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes,
but the ``Who Survived the Titanic'' visualization's use of typographic
attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly,
such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across
classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or
not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and
area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion
of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text
replacement to indicate gender and the passengers names.

The authors round out the article by addressing the most common
criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being
whether or not text should even be considered an element of data
visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding
of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more
investment of attention to understand. Another criticism is that textual
representations are not as visually appealing even when used
effectively. However, the authors counter that ``this criticism
indicates both the strength and weakness of type? that while text may
not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be
particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is
needed, without sacrificing representation of higher level patterns.
Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in
visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception
so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This
problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying
lengths representations of passengers�? names, and was corrected by only
including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only
vary so much.

\section{Contemporary Research Results \& What's
Next}\label{contemporary-research-results-whats-next}

With the development, studies and new tools applied in data
visualization, more people understand it matters \citep{next_steps} .
But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and
training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we
asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the
field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares
some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new
approaches \citep{next_steps}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Adapting the Publication and Review Process:} As the article
  states, ``both `good' and `bad' reviews could serve as valuable
  guides'', so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for
  fledgling practitioners in the field.
\item
  \textbf{Promoting Discussion and Accretion:} Discussion of research
  papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within
  research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or
  non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the
  online forum.
\item
  \textbf{Research Methods Training:} Developing a core curriculum for
  data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students
  and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods
  were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS
  faculty organized a new course on
  \href{http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/}{Designing Computer Science
  Experiments}. Also, online resources could be reinforced with a
  catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided
  study to online courses. Useful examples include Jake Wobbrock's
  Practical Statistics for HCI and Pierre Dragicevic's resources for
  reforming statistical practice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Using Data Visualization to find insights in
data}\label{using-data-visualization-to-find-insights-in-data}

\citep{data_journ} is extracted from a book known as Data Journalism
Handbook and this is one of the chapters of the book. The author starts
the article by introducing a very simple idea that loading any data set
into a spreadsheet can also be a form of visualization as an invisible
data becomes visible in a picture form into a table. Hence the focus
should not be whether we need data visualization or not but should be on
which form of data visualization is best in which situation. The author
then proceeds by stating that data visualization will not always unleash
a ready made story on its own. Sometimes the insights are known before
the visualization and sometimes an insight can be completely new. The
author has given a process for finding insights in the following way:

Visualize Data-\textgreater{} Analyze -\textgreater{} Document Insights
-\textgreater{} Transform Datasets -\textgreater{} Visualize Data

Each stage is explained in-depth further. Data Visualization can be done
in many ways such as tables which are great for one dimensional data
however they are bad for multi-dimensional data. Then he goes further to
explain the situation where each type of visualization such as bar
charts, maps, scatter plots, graphs, etc. are used. This gives a
thorough understanding of when to use which type of visualization. Once
we visualize the data we need to ask the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What can I see in this image? Is it what I expected?
\item
  Are there any interesting patterns?
\item
  What does this mean in the context of the data?
\end{itemize}

The basic question answer format gives an idea to the viewers about what
kind of perspectives can we look at the data. Sometimes we discover
something and sometimes we don't. But the author mentions that we always
learn something from the visualization. Once we document the data
insights based on the above question we need to have the following
points into consideration:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why have I created this chart?
\item
  What have I done to the data to create it?
\item
  What does this chart tell me?
\end{itemize}

The above question answer format compels the viewers to think deeper
about what exactly we are trying to find. Because many times the viewers
are simply too overwhelmed with the size of data that they lose the
basic idea. Hence this kind of approach help to stay focused. The author
then mentions that based on the above insights we might have some idea
about some interesting patterns. Since we already have an idea we might
want to see it in more detail and hence we transform data in more
details such as Zooming, Filtering, Outlier Removal. The author then
explains how transformed data can help us to see a more detailed view of
our insights.

Further the author gives a detailed explanation of which data
visualization tool to use based on the situation. The entire process
given above is explained in depth with the help of examples. The
technical approach listed above is practical and can be implemented
easily on our data visualization projects. I liked the author's approach
because he has cleverly integrated the step-by-step process of finding
insights with the technical way of handling data sets using tools such
as Tableau, Python, etc. And the process can be repeated many times till
we find the insights we are looking for.

\section{Best practices for
visualization}\label{best-practices-for-visualization}

This article talks about the right charts to be used for various kinds
of analysis \citep{DataVizBestPrac}. It is very relevant for data
science students as we would be interested in presenting our analysis
using simple and effective visualizations that tell the complete story.
Some of key areas for which the author highlights some best practices
are for visualizing trends over time, comparison and ranking,
correlation, distribution, geographical data etc. The author gives
examples on how simple graphs can also become more effective by just
adding a few more elements or some simple adjustments. I feel this is a
great starting point to create effective charts and we may use these
principles also when we start doing advanced analytics.

\section{Story Telling with Data}\label{story-telling-with-data}

Story telling is an essential part of data visualization. It is
extremely important to effectively communicate information through the
visualization. Stikeleather (2013)'s article talked about how a visual
designer tells a story with a visualization. Mainly there are five
strategies that can be applied during visualization:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Find the compelling narrative.
\item
  Think about the audience (e.g., novice, generalist, managerial,
  export, executive)
\item
  Be objective and offer balance
\item
  Don't censor
\item
  Finally, Edit, Edit, Edit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Corporate Scorecards and Data
Visualization}\label{corporate-scorecards-and-data-visualization}

Corporate transparency, flat organizations, open book policies, etc. are
terms executives and entrepreneurs learn about all the time
\citep{SCORECARDS}. As the corporate world shifts towards a more open
culture, the demand for open data and insights have increased
dramatically. This shift has helped the overall corporate strategic
planning and management process--easing the alignment of business
activities towards a series of goals. Being transparent top down aligns
the culture to sail towards the same North Star. The growth of corporate
transparency is not only important internally, but externally as well.
Corporate certifications like B Corporations certifications (B Corp),
require companies to provide a transparent view on their social
conscious efforts to the general public. Achieving the certification is
one step of the process; the true goal is to show the world how and why
the certification is truly deserved.

How does data visualization play a part? Data Visualization helps reveal
insights and patterns that are not immediately visible in the raw data.
Here's the process on how to get it done:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.04\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Step}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.11\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Name}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.11\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Perform Data Discovery and Determine The Story\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Before this step it is easy to underestimate the effort level it takes
to pull the best insights from the data. Data manipulation products like
Tableau, Domo, Pentaho, IBM's Many Eyes, and R, among others, make
insight extraction that much easier to gain understanding of data using
a visual medium. The key is to start with a simple portion of your data
and to start pulling basic insights to visualize and correlate with each
other. This process leads towards a compound series of questions, which
helps provide an overall vision to the end product. We see the effect
during our discovery process, which leads to unforeseen avenues for data
intelligence.\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.11\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Data Infrastructure Setup\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Data infrastructures can be simple or complex depending what the end
goal is. Many clients prefer to go the route of complete data
integration in order to centralize their data repositories. Technologies
such as Hadoop have helped by unifying disparate data sources, but other
options such as data cloud environments can help produce API's for
future product deployments. Why is this important? Accessibility of data
is an important foundation not only within the context of dashboards,
but also the possibility of branching out to other products.\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.11\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Product Design \& Development\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Wireframing, prototyping, and application development are the main
engines to transform an idea into a final product. Products can range
from static presentations/reports to full interactive applications.
Mobile, tablet, TV, and workstation platforms can all be mediums to help
deliver the final product. The secret to a great end product is how well
the data story is conceptualized. If the story is weak then the end
product will also suffer.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.04\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.11\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
QA \& Product Release\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The best part of any project is to get it finalized and released for all
to see. All data gets verified for accuracy, functionality testing (if
applicable), application flow (if applicable), design testing, and
remaining items are all completed. The end result is an engaging visual
product for all intended audiences to see and use.\strut

\subsection{Comparison of Different
Tools}\label{comparison-of-different-tools}

\textbf{Interactive Data Visualization}

In Data Mining, there are different processes involve carrying out the
data mining process such as data extraction, data management, data
transformations, data pre-processing, etc. In Data Visualization, the
primary goal is to convey the information efficiently and clearly
without any deviations or complexities in the form of statistical
graphs, information graphs, and plots. Also, the author listed the top 7
comparisons between data mining and data visualization, and 12 key
differences between data mining and data visualization. After reading
the article, you will have a very clear understanding of what are data
mining and data visualization and the characters for those two
techniques.

\section{Interactive Data
Visualization}\label{interactive-data-visualization}

Interactive or Dynamic data visualization delivers today's complex sea
of data in a graphically compelling and an easy-to-understand way. It
enables direct actions on a plot to change elements and link between
multiple plots. It enables users to accomplish traditional data
exploration tasks by making charts
interactive\citep{benefits_interactive_viz}.

Benefits of Interactive Data Visualization Software:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Absorb information in constructive ways: With the volume and velocity
  of data created everyday, dynamic data viz enables enhanced process
  optimization, insight discovery and decision making.
\item
  Visualize relationships and patterns: Helps in better understanding of
  correlations among operational data and business performance.
\item
  Identify and act on emerging trends faster: Helps decision makers to
  grasp shifts in behaviors and trends across multiple data sets much
  more quickly.
\item
  Manipulate and interact directly with data: Enables users to engage
  data more frequently.
\item
  Foster a new business language : Ability to tell a story through data
  that instantly relates the performance of a business and its assets.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{There are multiple ways by which interactive data visualizations
can be developed:}

\subsection{D3.js}\label{d3.js}

D3.js stands for Data Driven Document, a JS library for interactive Big
Data visualization in literally ANY way required
real-time\citep{d3_interactive_viz}. This is not a tool, mind you, so a
user should have a solid understanding of JavaScript to work with the
data and present it in a humanly-understandable form. To say more, this
library renders the data into SVG and HTML5 formats, so older browsers
like IE7 and 8 cannot leverage D3.js capabilities.

The data gathered from disparate sources like huge-scale data sets is
bind in real-time with DOM to produce interactive animations ( 2D and 3D
alike) in an extremely rapid way. The D3 architecture allows the users
to intensively reuse the codes across a variety of add-ons and plug-ins.
Some of the key advantages are: It is dynamic, free and open source and
very flexible with all web technologies, the ability to handle big data
and the functional style allows to reuse the codes.

\textbf{The Hitchhiker' Guide to d3.js} is a wonderful guide for
self-teaching d3.js. This guide is meant to prepare readers mentally as
well as give readers some fruitful directions to pursue. There is a lot
to learn besides the d3.js API, both technical knowledge around web
standards like HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript as well as communication
concepts and data visualization principles. Chances are you know
something about some of those things, so this guide will attempt to give
you good starting points for the things you want to learn more about.

It starts from the insights of learning d3.js by showing interviews with
those top visualization practitioners. Then the author gives key
concepts and useful features for learning visualization like d3-shape,
d3 selection, d3-collection, ds-hierarchy, ds-zoom as well as d3-force.

My favorite part of this guide is it lists a lot of useful resources
links for learning d3.js. For example, it recommends d3 API Reference,
2000+ d3 case studies and tutorials for d3. I did my exploratory
analysis version of group project on d3. And I found this guide helpful
during the progress. It also includes some meetup groups here in the bay
area. So, maybe we can meet data friends through the group.

\subsection{Tableau}\label{tableau}

Tableau is amid the market leaders for the Big Data visualization,
especially efficient for delivering interactive data visualization for
the results derived from Big Data operations, deep learning algorithms
and multiple types of AI-driven apps \citep{tableau_interactive_viz}.
Tableau can be integrated with Amazon AWS, MySQL, Hadoop, Teradata and
SAP, making this solution a versatile tool for creating detailed graphs
and intuitive data representation. This way the C-suite and middle-chain
managers are able to make grounded decisions based on informative and
easily-readable Tableau graphs. Tableau is business intelligence (BI)
and analytics platform created for the purposes of helping people see,
understand, and make decisions with data. It is the industry leader in
interactive data visualization tools, offering a broad range of maps,
charts, graphs, and more graphical data presentations. It is a painless
option when cost is not a concern and you do not need advanced and
complex analysis.The application is very handy for quickly visualizing
trends in data, connecting to a variety of data sources, and mapping
cities/regions and their associated data.

The key advantages are: It provides non technical user the ability to
build complex reports and dashboard with zero coding skills. Using
drag-n-drop functionalities of Tableau, user can create a very
interactive visuals within minutes. It can handle millions of rows of
data with ease and users can make live to connections to different data
sources like SQL etc.

\subsection{R Shiny}\label{r-shiny}

R Shiny enables us to produce interactive data visualizations with a
minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Java using a simple web application
framework that runs under the R statistical platform
\citep{shiny_interactive_viz}. Standalone apps can be hosted on a
webpage or embedded in R Markdown documents and dashboards can be built
using R shiny. It combines the computational power of R with the
interactivity of the modern web. The main advantages of using R Shiny
are : Its flexibility of pulling in whatever package in R that you want
to solve your problem, reaping the benefits of an open source ecosystem
for R and JavaScript visualization libraries, thereby allowing to create
highly custom applications and enabling timely, high quality interactive
data experience without (or with much less) web development and without
the limitations or cost of proprietary BI tools.

\subsection{Jupyter}\label{jupyter}

\subsection{Google chart}\label{google-chart}

A free and powerful integration of all Google power. The tool is
rendering the resulting charts to HTML5/SVG, so they are compatible with
any browser. Support for VML ensures compatibility with older IE
versions, and the charts can be ported to the latest releases of Android
and iOS. What's even more important, Google chart combines the data from
multiple Google services like Google Maps. This results in producing
interactive charts that absorb data real-time and can be controlled
using an interactive dashboard.

\section{Tufte's Design Principles of graphical
excellence}\label{tuftes-design-principles-of-graphical-excellence}

A graph should be impressive and can obtain audience's attention. How
can we achieve this? We must consider several aspects:
\textbf{efficiency, complexity, structure, density and beauty}. We also
should consider the audience whether they will be confused about the
design. Statistical graphics are kind of graphics we use a lot for data
analysis so I want to summarize some principles mentioned in this
Tufte's great book.Here we must follow some principles for statistical
graphics:

\textbf{Principle 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within reason.}
Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink
arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.

Data-ink ratio = data-ink/total ink used to print the graphic =
proportion of graphic's ink devoted to the non-redundant display of
data-information

This basic principle follows by two principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Erase non-data-ink, within reason.
\item
  Erase redundant data-ink, within reason.
\item
  always revise and edit.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The graphs will be better for more information per unit of space an d
  per unit of ink is displayed.
\item
  Graphics are almost always going to improve as they go through editing
  ,revision, and testing against different design options.
\item
  Try to figure out whether the audience looking at the new designs be
  confused? Nothing is lost to those puzzled by the frame of dashes,and
  something is gained by those who do understand. We can also assume
  that if you understand the statistical graphics, most other readers
  will, too because it is a frequent mistake in thinking about
  statistical graphics to underestimate the audience.
\item
  Some of the new designs may appear odd, but this is probably because
  we have not seen them before.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Principle 2: Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several
times over, to show the data.} The danger of multi-functioning elements
is that they tend to generate graphical puzzles, with encodings that can
only be broken by their inventor.Thus design techniques for enhancing
graphical clarity in the face of complexity must be developed along with
multi-functioning elements. In other words, we should try to make all
present graphical elements data encoding elements.We must make every
graphical element effective.

Example: \includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure6.png}
(source:\citep{Tufte_2001})

\textbf{Principle 3: maximize data density and the size of the data
matrix, within reason.} High performance graphics should be design with
special care. As volume of data increases, data measures must shrink
(smaller dots for scatters,thinner lines for busy time-series)
\citep{best-practice}.

Data Density = \# entries in data matrix /area of data graphic

\textbf{Principle 4: Escape flatland -- small multiples, parallel
sequencing.} Data is multivariate. Does not't necessarily mean 3D
projection. How can we enhance multivariate data on inherently 2D
surfaces?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Example for small multiples.

\item
  Example for parallel sequencing
  \includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure7.png} (source:\citep{Tufte_2001})
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Principle 5: Macro/Micro-Provide the user with both views
(overview and detail).} Carefully designed view can show a macro
structure (overview) as well as micro structure (detail) in one space.

Example:\\
\includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure9.png} (source:\citep{Tufte_2001})

\textbf{Principle 6: Utilize Layering \& Separation.} Supported by
Gestalt laws (The principles of grouping): 1. Grouping with colors 2.
Using Color to separate 3. 1+1 = 3 (clutter)

Example: \includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure10.png}
(source:\citep{Tufte_2001})

\textbf{Principle 7: Utilize narratives of space and time.} Tell a story
of position and chronology through visual elements.

Example: \includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure11.png} (source:
\citep{narratives_2017}) \includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure12.png}

\section{Visual Data Communication}\label{visual-data-communication}

We want visualizations to speak about the data. This article is about
some tips that can help visualizations to speak:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Keep it simple:} Keep charts simple and easy to interpret.
  Instead of overloading peoples brain with lots of information, keep
  only the necessary things in the chart and help the audience
  understand quickly what's going on.
\item
  \textbf{Pretty doesn't mean effective:} There is a misconception that
  aesthetically pleasing visualization is more effective.To draw
  attention, sometimes we want them to be pretty and eye-catching. But
  if it fails to communicate that data properly, then you'll lose
  people's interest as quickly as you gained it.
\item
  \textbf{Color for Numerical Scales:} Color for numerical scales should
  be used with caution.The way you interpret a shade depends on the
  colors around it and sometimes it can lead to false conclusions.For
  data with geographical fields, it may be tempting to use maps. But
  maps may not be very effective for the following reasons:
\item
  \textbf{Leverage Color Associations:} When we say strawberries we
  associate red color with it. If we can leverage the how people
  associate different colors for different things, we will not even need
  legend to interpret things. Color can be used to leverage long-term
  memory very quickly.
\item
  \textbf{Use Bright Colors to Highlight:} To attract attention to a
  certain part of data, bright colors can be used. Alarm colors draw the
  eye quickly to areas that need attention and help get that message
  across.
\item
  \textbf{Maps} Use of maps can be tricky. Geographical data doesn't
  imply a map. Maps can be useful for application where proximity
  matters they can be great for applications where proximity matters,
  but for straight ``what is higher'' type comparisons, they're not very
  effective as large regions will draw attention easier than smaller
  regions due to more concentrated color.
\item
  \textbf{5 Second Rule:} Research shows that on average modern
  attention span for looking at things online is less than 5 seconds. So
  if you can't grab attention within 5 minutes, you've likely lost your
  viewer. Includes clear titles and instructions and tell people
  succinctly what the visualization shows and how to interact with it.
\end{itemize}

\section{Gestalt Principles for Data
Viz}\label{gestalt-principles-for-data-viz}

\citep{principles-fusioncharts} is a detailed white paper PDF from
FusionCharts that explores key aspects of effective data visualization
in the business world, from goals to preattentive attributes to applying
Gestalt Principles. Because some of the aspects such as using color and
design effectively have been covered earlier on in the Fundamentals
section, this summary will mainly focus on the Gestalt Principles.

Data is simply a collection of many individual elements (i.e.,,
observations, typically represented as rows in a data table). In data
viz, our goal is usually to group these elements together in a
meaningful way to highlight patterns and anomalies. Described this way,
it makes sense that Gestalt Principles are a good set of guidelines for
data viz, because these principles describe how we assemble different
elements into groups.

\textbf{The Gestalt Principles include the following:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Proximity: white space can be used to group elements together and
  separate others
\item
  Similarity: objects that look similar are instinctively grouped
  together in our minds
\item
  Enclosure: helps distinguish between groups
\item
  Symmetry
\item
  Closure: we tend to complete shapes and paths even if part of them is
  missing
\item
  Continuity: similar to closure
\item
  Connection: helps group elements together as well
\item
  Figure and ground: we typically notice only one of several main visual
  aspects of a graph; what we do notice becomes the figure, and
  everything else becomes the ``background''. This one is especially
  interesting because it is not as obvious as some of the others, but is
  really important in matching a data viz design to its purpose.
\end{enumerate}

The principles are quite theoretical and in practice, preattentive
attributes such as spatial position, size, and color are means of
applying the principles.

\section{10 Best Data Visualization Projects of
2015}\label{best-data-visualization-projects-of-2015}

\citep{10_BEST} picks the top 10 projects for the best data
visualization of 2015, for each pick, the author showed the project plot
and also described the reason why he chose. So after reading this
article, I have a basic understanding of what kind of characters should
include in a good visualization project.

\section{15 Cool Information Graphics and Data Viz from

Other Crazy Current
Events}\label{data-visualizations-that-explain-trump-the-white-oscars-and-other-crazy-current-events}

\citep{int_viz_2}

Case studies contain valuable information about development records. The
evaluation and study of case study helps show that the new design is
just as usable as existing techniques, making it suitable for future
development. This chapter contains some very useful case studies. Many
of the case studies below come from the following articles:

Visualization is like art. It speaks where words fail. There are
phenomena like the Syrian war, the number flights during Thanksgiving in
the USA, the understanding of depths for developing perspective about
the range of the issue, the controversy of `\#OscarsSoWhite', etc. on
which we can write bundles of paragraphs, but they might still have
scope for ambiguity. The links show some intricate visualizations of the
topics like those mentioned above, and speak volumes without requiring
paragraphs to explain what is going on within these visualizations.
According to me, it is really interesting to see that almost anything in
this world can be explained by visualizations. Visualizations are not
just limited to businesses and their analytics. Wars, rescue operations,
etc. can also be visualized to get a clear idea of all the details of
the issues.

\section{Connecting the Dots Behind the
Election}\label{connecting-the-dots-behind-the-election}

This article by the New York Times lists several different candidates
and creates compelling visuals that link their campaigns to previous
ones \citep{campaign_staff}\citep{cool_data}. Each visual contains
several different-sized dots that represent a specific campaign,
administration, or other governmental organization related to the
candidate's current campaign, which are then connected by arrows.
Hovering over a specific dot highlights the connections between the
groups. The visual is a great way to put what would otherwise be a long
slog through years of information into an easily accessible, easily
view-able format so that voters can figure out where the candidates'
experiences lie.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section{Spies in the Skies}\label{spies-in-the-skies}

\citep{spies_sky} referenced in \citep{cool_data}

The map is filled with red and blue lines (representing FBI and DHS
aircraft, respectively) which illustrate the flight paths of the planes.
When planes circle an area more than once, the circles become darker.
The circles change in accordance to day and time, and individual cities
can be typed into a search bar to see the flight patterns over them. The
visualization, rather creatively, almost looks like a hand-drawn map.
While presenting a normally uncomfortable topic, this allows individuals
to check things for themselves, hopefully providing some peace of mind.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/NYCflights.png}
\caption{New York Flight Patterns}
\end{figure}

\section{Green Honey}\label{green-honey}

\citep{green_honey} referenced in \citep{cool_data}

The visualization spans a webpage. As you scroll down, the text changes,
as do many colored dots that move over the white background. The dots
are used to represent not only each colors' hue, but the numbers that
fall into each category---for example, what colors are the most popular
``base'' colors for English and Chinese. The continuous flow of this
visualization helps really bring it together, allowing users to scroll
through the information at their own pace, but also creating a seamless,
creative work.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/colorwords.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\section{How People Like You Spend Their
Time}\label{how-people-like-you-spend-their-time}

\citep{spendingtime} referenced in \citep{cool_data} The visual lists
several categories along one side of a graph---such as ``personal care''
and ``work''---with a line illustrating the amount of time the average
person in a certain demographic spends on each subject. Entering
different statistics at the top---such as changing gender or
age---causes the lines to shift to feature that demographic. The
simplicity of this visualization really helps the information get across
and avoids bogging down the statistics. Sometimes, less is more.

\section{Is it Better to Rent or
Buy?}\label{is-it-better-to-rent-or-buy}

reference: \citep{rent_or_buy} \includegraphics{images/SpendingTime.png}

The calculator includes several sloping charts. Each chart includes a
factor that'll affect how much you'll have to pay, such as the
individual cost of your home and your mortgage rates. A movable scale
along the bottom of each chart allows you to enter different data,
changing the ``cost of rent per month'' on the side. If you can find a
similar house to rent for that much per month or less, it's more cost
effective to just rent the home. This visualization is incredibly
thorough and a useful tool for homeowners of any age and status.

\section{Two Centuries of U.S.
Immigration}\label{two-centuries-of-u.s.-immigration}

\citep{Immigration} referenced in \citep{cool_data}

The interactive map shows the rate of immigration into the U.S. from
other countries over the last 200 years in 10-year segments. Colored
dots represent 10,000 people coming from the specified country.
Countries then light up when they have one of the highest rates of
migration. What makes this a good visualization is that it is engaging
and easy to read and interpret. The movement of the dots draws the
reader's attention while the brightly lit countries make it easy to pick
out the highest total migrations.

\begin{figure}

\section{What's really warming the
world?}\label{whats-really-warming-the-world}

\citep{world_warming} referenced in \citep{int_viz_1}

In this case study, it first claimed the background story and the
analytic questions clearly. Then it analyzed each different factor
separately using both verbal explanations and dynamic graphics to
compare with the observed temperature movements, and then grouped
related factors into Natural factors category or Human factors category.
After that, it combined all the dynamic graphics into one and made the
results more straightforward in terms of comparisons. In the end, the
authors also provided more detailed explanations with data set sources
to support the results shown above. Overall, this case study is
straightforward, easy to understand but also with enough information
shown on each graphics.

Visualization is like art. It speaks where words fail. There are
phenomena like the Syrian war, the number flights during Thanksgiving in
the USA, the understanding of depths for developing perspective about
the range of the issue, the controversy of `\#OscarsSoWhite', etc. on
which we can write bundles of paragraphs, but they might still have
scope for ambiguity.

The links show some intricate visualizations of the topics like those
mentioned above, and speak volumes without requiring paragraphs to
explain what is going on within these visualizations.

\section{The Strengths of Animated Data
Visualization}\label{the-strengths-of-animated-data-visualization}

\citep{American_life} According to me, it is really interesting to see
that almost anything in this world can be explained by visualizations.
Visualizations are not just limited to businesses and their analytics.
Wars, rescue operations, etc. can also be visualized to get a clear idea
of all the details of the issues.

The page linked above includes a great example of animated data
visualization showing the time people spend on daily activities
throughout the day. The plot is simple and easy to interpret, but it
also includes a good number of variables including time, activity type,
number of people doing each activity, and the order in which activities
are done.

One of the plot's biggest strengths is that by using one dot to
represent each person in the study and using animation, we can actually
drill down to each individual and follow them throughout the day. The
accumulation of dots for each particular activity also gives us an
aggregate-level view of the same data, so we get both an individual and
aggregate insights.

A drawback of the plot is that it is hard for our eyes to keep track of
1000 simultaneously moving dots. The author of the post addresses this
by creating subsequent plots with stationary lines at key times of the
day. This represents people's movements from one activity to another
without overwhelming the reader.

Overall, this is an engaging, informative, and fun animated plot that
has relevance and tells a story.

\section{An Aging Nation: Projected Number of Children and Older
Adults}\label{an-aging-nation-projected-number-of-children-and-older-adults}

\citep{aging_nation} Aging population is always a hot topic in social
economics and politics. I collected several different data
visualizations that show the aging population in the world. They are
good examples to learn and apply to census data.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/aging_nation.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This one includes bar chart and line graph to demonstrate the aging
population compared with population of children. The good things about
this visualization: simple to see and compare, color to differentiate
the category, highlight the intersection point.

\section{From Pyramid to Pillar: A Century of Change, Population of the
U.S.}\label{from-pyramid-to-pillar-a-century-of-change-population-of-the-u.s.}

\citep{population_pyramid}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Pyramid.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This is a \textbf{population pyramid}. ``A \textbf{population pyramid}
is a pair of back-to to histograms for each sex that displays the
distribution of a population in all age groups and in gender''. It is a
good candidate to compare changes in population distributions (sex, age,
year). Also the shape of pyramid is used to interpret a population. To
illustrate, A pyramid with a very wide base and a narrow top section
suggests a population with both high fertility and death rates. It is a
useful tool in the census data. \citep{animated_pyramid} offers an
animated pyramid.

\includegraphics{images/3_1.png} This is an animated and multiple
population pyramids. It used to compare different patterns across
countries. One additional benefit for the interactive population pyramid
is that it shows the shape changes year by year, which is useful for
continuous time-series comparison. A similar project with R code is

\section{A guide to Who is Fighting Whom in
Syria}\label{a-guide-to-who-is-fighting-whom-in-syria}

Picking up from one of the charts shown in the above mentioned link
\citep{int_viz_1}, the visualization of `A guide to Who is Fighting Whom
in Syria' is one of the most interesting charts in the list. The
visualization and its report can be seen at \citep{syria_chart} Picking
up from one of the charts shown in the above mentioned link
\citep{int_viz_1}, the visualization of `A guide to Who is Fighting Whom
in Syria' is one of the most interesting charts in the list. The
visualization and its report can be seen at

\begin{figure}

This visualization makes an extremely complicated topic like the Syrian
War easily understandable. It consists of 3 different emojis in three
different colors, with each (color+facial expression) combination
showing the relationship between the various groups involved in the
Syrian War. When you click on each of the emoji, a small dialogue box
pops up which explains the relationship between the various countries
and rebel groups involved in the war. This is not only easy to
understand, but it is also pleasing to the eyes.

\section{Adding up the White Oscars
Winners}\label{adding-up-the-white-oscars-winners}

\citep{oscars_sowhite_chart} referenced in \citep{int_viz_2}

A visualization of all previous winners of the Best Actor/Actress Oscar
winners can be seen here \citep{oscars_sowhite_chart} in an article by
Bloomberg. The writers of this article developed the attributes of the
future winners of Oscars by taking up the attributes of the past
winners. It is extremely interesting to see how the article shows the
features of the Best Actress, Actor, movies, etc. in a simple and
captivating visual. The visualization is interactive and we can click on
each attribute like `Hair Color', `Eye Color', etc. to see what are the
features of the actors and actresses who are more likely to win the
Oscars.

\section{Young voters, class and turnout: how Britain voted in
2017}\label{young-voters-class-and-turnout-how-britain-voted-in-2017}

\citep{UKvotes2017} The article's goal is to convey the change in party
votes in the 2017 UK general election compared to votes in 2015. The
change in party votes was shown with regards to three demographic
factors: age, class, and ethnicity. For each factor, there are four
graphs (one per political party), each illustrated in their party's
standard color. The change in percent of votes is shown as an arrow
where the arrow's shaft is the length of the difference from 2015 to
2017 while the x-axis is the demographic factor split into different
bins. What makes this a good visualization is that it is very easy to
read and interpret. The color-coding of the arrows and party name makes
it easy to pick out the different parties and the arrow lengths
highlight just how large of a change happened. For example, in the Age
section, it is easy to see the pattern between the Labour party gaining
many voters ages 18 to 44 and the Conservative party gaining voters ages
45 and up.

\section{Uber: Crafting Data-Driven
Maps}\label{uber-crafting-data-driven-maps}

\citep{uber_maps} Map visualization is very important for companies like
Uber that needs to track metrics using geo space points. In this
article, the designer from Uber talks about the challenges of design
such visualization and their solutions. While a lot of the problems are
related to the large scale of the data, there are some insights on using
scatter plots and hex bins, adding trip lines and making custom tools to
help make decisions. The visualization in this article is beneficial for
developing geo spatial graphics.

\section{Linguistic Concepts}\label{linguistic-concepts}

\citep{lingui_data} Following the idea behind this article, it helped
understand the case study and its importance. \citep{article_case}. The
case study follows. This case study is about the linguistic concepts
usage. How the data is being used and how visual graphics is used to
deliver the insight. It presents an educational tool that integrates
computational linguistics resources for use in non-technical
undergraduate language science courses. By using the tool in conjunction
with case studies, it provides opportunities for students to gain an
understanding of linguistic concepts and analysis through the lens of
realistic problems in feasible ways.

\section{Kissmetrics blog: visualization of
metrics}\label{kissmetrics-blog-visualization-of-metrics}

\citep{facebook_organic} Kissmetrics blog is a place where people talk
about analytics, marketing and testing through narratives and metrics
visualization. Metrics are important in real-life world especially when
developing/promoting products. Visualization of metrics are also
essential so that stakeholders can monitor performance, identify
problems and deep dive into potential issues.

A good example from the Kissmetrics blog is about Facebook's Organic
Reach. One important point in the blog discussed whether the Facebook's
organic reach is decreasing drastically. The general trend shows that
there is a huge decline in Facebook's page organic reach.

The following graphs show that the engagement is actually increasing,
meaning while the quantity of content is decreasing, the quality is
increasing.

\begin{figure}

different perspectives of interpreting data can lead to different
conclusions.

The first large graph contains 255 lines to show how the number of jobs
has changed for every industry in America. Using color to highlight the
lines lets viewers see the specifics for each industry. By hovering over
a line, the detailed information of that industry's job trend will show
up. Keeping this extra data hidden until needed makes it easier for
readers to absorb information from this otherwise huge data
visualization. Below the overall chart on top are subsets categorized by
job sector and sub-industries. Readers can choose the industry or sector
they are interested in and, like in the first graph, view the more
detailed information by hovering over a line.

\section{Vizwiz blog: case studies about how to improve your
visualizations}\label{vizwiz-blog-case-studies-about-how-to-improve-your-visualizations}

This is a blog about Tableau based data visualization. The author is
Andy Kriebel who is a famous Tableau Zen Master. I would like to
recommend this blog because it is not only practical, but also full of
insights.

My favorite part of this blog is so called ``Makeover Monday'', which
will develop a new visualization based on an original one.

An interesting case study could be \citep{case_thesis}. It is a thesis
but it has interesting insights about visualization using mobile data.

For example, the author re-designed ``The Seasonality of Confirmed
Malaria Cases in Zambia Southern Province'' by pointing out ``what works
well'', ``what could be improved'' and also his goals for the new
visualization (ref: \url{http://www.vizwiz.com/2018/04/malaria.html})
That's how you can learn all the insight and reason behind a good
visualization. \citep{vizwiz_malaria}

the claim in a 1973 suit that charged the school with sex
discrimination. Though the graduate schools had accepted 44\% of male
applicants but only 35\% of female applicants, researchers later
uncovered that if the data were properly pooled, there was actually a
small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. That's
called a Simpson's Paradox.

in Napoleon's 1812 Russian army, their movements, and the temperatures
they encountered along their way. It's been called one of the ``best
statistical drawings ever created.'' The work is an important reminder
that the fundamentals of data visualization lie in a nuanced
understanding of the many dimensions of data. Tools like D3.js and HTML
are no good without a firm grasp of your data set and sharp
communication skills.

\subsection{Tableau: Viz of the Day}\label{tableau-viz-of-the-day}

Tableau has a gallery called
\href{https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery}{Viz of the Day} that
displays great data visualization examples created by Tableau. It is
cool to see how people are using all kinds of data to create informative
yet fun data visuals. Data being used is also attached so we can try to
mimic what other people did as well.

\section{Application of Data
Visualization}\label{application-of-data-visualization}

There are ways to use data visualization at every level of an
organization. These applications lets us quickly create insightful
visualizations, in minutes. It allows users to visualize data and
explore the vast domain interactively. Ref: \citep{app1} Some of them
are mentioned below:

\subsection{Data Augmentation}\label{data-augmentation}

\citep{ref_pdf_ar}

Computer interfacing is changing everyday, it is important for our
clients to adapt the technology. The language of communicating data in
3D is explored to understand ways to take advantage of all dimensions in
augmented reality and virtual reality to deliver information based on
the user's perspective, interest, and urgency.

Creating a mechanism to become aware of the user's intention by
analyzing the gaze through reactive design, we achieved developing a
complex system for demonstrating massive amount of data and organizing
it in a spatial system. The user could walk through and explore the data
and interact with different data visualizations. Moving through space is
used to provide different levels of detail for specific data through Z
axis.

Analytical engineer Steluta Iordache states virtual reality is changing
the environment of data analysis. It has long been predicted that
augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will, sooner rather than
later, dive head first into the mainstream of public consciousness. Now,
expectations are to meeting reality, and heavy investment from tech
giants such as Facebook, Samsung, and Google, this seems inevitable.
However, placing the headsets and gaming -- the industry most experts
believe AR and VR will most dynamically disrupt -- to one side, these
nascent technologies can be used by corporate organisations, too.

By using proper visualization, it is possible to discover a solution
more easily. By using proper visualization, it is possible to simplify
understanding of a problem and discover a solution more easily. Using VR
and AR you could build a more efficient visualization of the data.
Recently we have seen data integrated in the real world and users have
been able to interact with that data, which is not possible with
traditional methods such as plots and charts. We believe AR and VR can
build the presentation of the data and show more information at the same
time, and it can allow the viewer to explore the data by interacting
with it. But when we analyse data it can be difficult to see the big
picture while also having access to the detail. So the question is: how
can AR and VR be used to understand complex data by interacting with it
within a virtual environment? You can find the answer
here\citep{vr_education}

\subsection{Outlier Detection}\label{outlier-detection}

\citep{outliar}

We use data visualization for outliar detection in the data set.
Different methods for outlier detection in functional data have been
developed during the years. Among them, several rely on different
notions of functional depth , on robust principal components, or on
random projections of infinite-dimensional data into R. Also, some
distributional approaches have been considered (Gervini, 2009). In
functional data analysis, we observe curves defined over a given real
interval and shape outliers may be defined as those curves that exhibit
a different shape from the rest of the sample. Whereas magnitude
outliers, that is, curves that lie outside the range of the majority of
the data, are in general easy to identify, shape outliers are often
masked among the rest of the curves and thus difficult to detect.
Ref:\citep{outliar}. Outlier treatment is important because, it can
drastically bias/change the fit estimates and predictions.

A simple example is mentioned below. Outlier treatment is important
because, it can drastically bias/change the fit estimates and
predictions. Illustration:

\subsection{Genetic Network
Reconstruction}\label{genetic-network-reconstruction}

Data visualization techniques are used to reconstruct genetic networks
from genomics data. Reconstructed genetic networks are predicted
interactions among genes of interest and these interactions are inferred
from genomics data,micro array data or DNA sequence. Genomics data are
generally contaminated and high-dimensional. It is important to examine
and clean data carefully to attain meaningful inferences. Thus
visualization tools that are used in the preprocessing of data
associated with genetic network reconstruction are also reviewed and
chosen wisely.

\section{Two Awesome Visualists}\label{two-awesome-visualists}

David McCandless is a British data-journalist and his blog
\emph{``Information is Beautiful''} \citep{info_beautiful} hosts some of
the most visually stunning graphs, charts and maps on a wide range of
topics like science, food, dogs and countries.

A chart on this blog ``International Number Ones: Because every country
is good at something (according to data)'' is an interesting and
captivating work that shows which country is No.1 in what.
\citep{country_chart}

Some of the interesting findings are as follows:

Hans Rosling took his interest in Global Health and developed stunning
visualizations about it using statistical methods and data from the UN.
He was a noted TED speaker and one of his most interesting TED talks is
\emph{``Asia's Rise: How and When''} \citep{hans}. In this, Hans shows
trends of the Western countries vs Developing countries like India and
China and makes predictions using stunning visualizations like the
Bubble chart. In this video, he also predicts the exact date on which
India and China will move ahead of USA as strong economic forces.

Hans was the co-founder and developer of the foundation
``Gapminder''\citep{gapminder} which develops tools to help the people
make sense of global data. One of the most important goals of Gapminder
foundation is to end ignorance in the world by developing fact-based
visualizations to show how the world really is.

Measures}\label{using-shapes-as-filters-in-tableau-when-your-fields-are-measures}

Reference: \citep{interworks}

I found this article quite useful for my individual project. This
article introduces the methodologies on how to use shapes as filters in
Tableau when your fields Are Measures. Basically, it teaches you how to
load custom shape as action filters and use them for showing different
graphs with those filters which can make your visualization more
interesting and interactive. You can also download the tableau file for
practice. This article is very useful to analyze and redesign the
different graphs presented in the article ``America's unique gun
violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts''.
Ref:\citep{gunviolence}. This article introduces the methodologies on
how to use shapes as filters in Tableau when the fields are Measures.
Basically, it teaches us how to load custom shape as action filters and

Case studies document the development record of a project.They provide
the user with an insight into what occurred and relevant details of the
process. A person can gain valuable knowledge that can be reused in
their own projects and allow their own system to be better simply by
learning from what others have done.

This article explains how data visualization can enhance awareness of
the data available and its importance in business decisions. The Author
explains a situation where poor data visualization led to bad decisions
and the impact that these decisions had.

\section{Visualization of big data security: a case study on the KDD99
cup data
set}\label{visualization-of-big-data-security-a-case-study-on-the-kdd99-cup-data-set}

This paper utilized visualization algorithm together with big data
analysis in order to gain better insights into the KDD99 data set:

\textbf{Abstract}

Cyber security has been thrust into the limelight in the modern
technological era because of an array of attacks often bypassing
untrained intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Therefore, greater
attention has been directed on being able deciphering better methods for
identifying attack types to train IDSs more effectively. Key
cyber-attack insights exist in big data; however, an efficient approach
is required to determine strong attack types to train IDSs to become
more effective in key areas. Despite the rising growth in IDS research,
there is a lack of studies involving big data visualization, which is
key. The KDD99 data set has served as a strong benchmark since 1999;
therefore, we utilized this data set in our experiment. In this study,
we utilized hash algorithm, a weight table, and sampling method to deal
with the inherent problems caused by analyzing big data; volume,
variety, and velocity. By utilizing a visualization algorithm, we were
able to gain insights into the KDD99 data set with a clear
identification of ``normal'' clusters and described distinct clusters of
effective attacks.

\section{Britain's diet in data}\label{britains-diet-in-data}

This is a very good example about how to present a large amount of
comprehensive data - distributed across different categories and
measured in different metrics - in a simple yet effective manner, while
still making it interesting to look at. The data product attempts to
show how the average Briton's diet has changed over the last 4 decades
for the better \citep{britain_diet_2016}. It does this by displaying
simple trend lines that show that more harmful and rich foods are being
consumed less and the healthier and leaner foods are being consumed
more. It further breaks down every major food categories into tens of
its constituent products, and in both the overview and deep-dive
versions, provides further levers to toggle and change to massage more
meaning out of the data. It also shows how the contribution of different
foods to the typical diet has changed over the years. Here, we can
toggle the year to see exactly how much of each food was consumed, again
with another deep-dive into the constituents of every major food group.

\includegraphics{images/britain-diet-data-trends.PNG} Source:
\citep{britain-diet-data-trends} referenced in \citep{britain_diet_2016}
\includegraphics{images/britain-diet-data-typical_diet.png} Source:
\citep{britain-diet-data-typical_diet} referenced in
\citep{britain_diet_2016}

Such a visualization is ideal for the layman wanting to walk away with a
basic but accurate understanding of the dietary changes, but also
provides plenty for the more discerning viewer who might have more time
and inclination to dissect and parse through the graphs. It is very
difficult to use the same visual/data product to cater to both types of
viewers in such a satisfactory capacity, which is what makes this
particular data product so alluring and effective. It satisfies the
principles of graphical excellence as stated by Edward Tufte
\citep{visual_display}

\begin{quote}
Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest
number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest
space.

\section{Avoiding Common Mistakes with Time
Series}\label{avoiding-common-mistakes-with-time-series}

This article explains how time series data visualization can sometimes
be deceptive. It first takes an example of two random time series data
and plots them on a graph which gives an impression that the two are
strongly correlated. But if we do some statistical testing the two do
not show any relationship, this is an example of ``correlation does not
necessary mean causation''. In another set of examples author has taken
trending two random time series data and shown how even statistical
tests can give a wrong interpretation. The article then explains using
visualization how a general trended time series can be different than a
more controlled and measured trending time series. master

\section{Building advanced analytics application with
TabPy**}\label{building-advanced-analytics-application-with-tabpy}

\citep{TabPy}

Imagine a scenario where we can just enter some x values in a dashboard
form, and the visualization would predict the y variable!!! Here is a
link that shows how to integrate and visualize data from Python in
Tableau. This is especially relevant to all data science students, as
this is one of the tools used for visualizing advanced analytics. The
author here has given an example using data from Seattle's police
department's 911 calls and he tries to identify criminal hotspots in the
area.The author uses machine learning (spatial clustering) and creates a
great interactive visualization, where you can click on the type of
criminal activity and the graph will show various clusters.There are
other examples and use cases that may be downloaded, and the scripts are
also given by the author for anyone who is interested in trying it out.

\section{Why pie chart is bad: a comparison with bar
chart}\label{why-pie-chart-is-bad-a-comparison-with-bar-chart}

Using pie chart is usually considered as a bad idea when it comes to
data visualization. But why? Here, we explore some cons of using pie
chart to convey information and compare its effectiveness to bar chart
\citep{hickey-pie-worst} \citep{henry-defense-pie} \citep{quach-penny}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Some information may look nearly identical in pie chart. But if the
  data is presented with bar charts, the story is different. See figure

\item
  It is difficult to compare the slices of a circle to figure out the
  distinctions in size between each pie slice, especially when there are
  a lot of categories. ** See figure \ref{fig:hickey-breakdown} for
  example.

  Pie chart may be useful when comparing 2 different categories with
  different amounts of information. Specifically, it does a better job
  to distinguish two parts with a 25:75 split or one that is not 50:50
  as people are sensitive to a right angle or a dividing line that is
  not straight. But this could be simply done by showing two numbers!
  See figure \ref{fig:henry-quarter} and \ref{fig:henry-half} for
  examples.

So before we start to plot, we should decide the baseline we want to
use. Different baseline will lead to totally different graphs.

\section{Using design patterns to find greater meaning in your
data}\label{using-design-patterns-to-find-greater-meaning-in-your-data}

Visualizations that show comparisons, connections, and conclusions offer
analytical clarity. Patterns based on function can help you see
differences and similarities more clearly, understand relationships and
behaviors more intimately, and predict future results with a greater
level of certainty. When these patterns are presented as visualizations,
they help you 1) see comparisons, 2) make connections, and 3) draw
conclusions from your data sets. The major functions can be described
as:

\subsection{Comparisons}\label{comparisons}

As shown in Figure 1, the bar chart with sparkline enables you to review
the data at two different levels: a high-level assessment of the
short-term three-month returns is represented with the bar chart, while
the sparkline (the line chart below the bar) provides the details of the
historical returns. Quickly and concisely, the sparkline shows you the
path that has led up to the most recent returns. You can then assess
that a narrow path provides consistent returns across the years while a
wide path provides varied returns. Side-by-side comparisons of funds
organized into two columns---\% Returns and \% Ahead of
Benchmark---enables peer comparisons and fund-specific benchmark
comparisons. Hence, you can see that not only has Global Large Cap Core
provided positive returns, it has also provided the best and most
consistent returns when compared to the benchmark.

\subsection{Connections}\label{connections}

The string of charts in Figure 2 shows 10-year to year-to-date (YTD)
performance returns, which can be interpreted as individual charts or a
group of category charts.

Similar to sounds waves, the symmetrical area charts grow equidistant
from the source (the zero line) at each time interval to accentuate the
returns even further. Here, the y-axis is shown in percentage. Instead
of using the zero line to indicate positive or negative returns, it uses
color to denote if the category returns are positive (black) or negative
(red). For example, Multi Cap Russell 3000 Growth produced 20\% positive
returns within the one-year time period and is shown with color fill in
both directions from the zero line to purposefully duplicate the large
gains and specifically uses black color fill to indicate the returns are
positive. As evident from the name, the symmetrical chart doubles the
returns to emphasize the amount with color fill.

What else can you derive from organizing the information in a spectrum
of negative to positive returns? Based on this organization, three
groups of categories have resulted in straight losses (red), heavy gains
(black), or a mix of gains and losses across a decade of returns. The
string of charts makes it easier for you to see these three groups of
categories to assess their distribution. Just like sound waves, each
chart is a sound bite that streams the returns for each category with a
``scream'' announcing a huge gain (e.g., Multi-Cap Russel 3000 Growth)
or loss (e.g., Mid Cap Russel Mid Cap Growth). In some cases (e.g.,
Large Cap S\&P 500), the chart quietly announces mixed returns to
adequately demand less attention.

Next, you might wonder how you would have fared if you had invested in
certain funds. You might ask: if I had purchased this fund five years
ago, what would my return be? And what about the YTD returns? Since
market timing is key to investment choices, the following presentation
of hypothetical investments represents a range of results.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

In Figure 3, varied performance results become clear with a layered
approach to show five potential entry points (10-year, 5-year, 3-year,
1-year, YTD) into an investment. For example, the International Large
Cap Core fund provided 27\% YTD returns, which contrast the negative
returns you would have received had you invested in the fund 1, 5, or 10
years ago. Here, conclusions are derived based on known inputs with a
divided review of positive or negative outcomes (shown on the y-axis).

The line weights help to identify each entry point and show the range of
differences between the entry points. Accordingly so, resulting returns
are shown with simplified curves that connect the inputs and outputs. In
this case, the chart has been customized to show an instance in which
the user has opted to see the YTD return values as percentages listed to
the right of each resulting output.\citep{data_meaning}

\section{Example Visualizations of Time Series
Data}\label{example-visualizations-of-time-series-data}

Reference: \citep{aya-time-series} What are some of the most common data
visualizations you see in newspapers, textbooks, and corporate annual
reports? Graphs showing a country's GDP growth trends or charts
capturing a company's sales growth in the last 4 quarters would be high
up on the list. Essentially, these are visualizations that track time
series data -- the performance of an indicator over a period of time --
also known as temporal visualizations.

Temporal visualizations are one of the simplest, quickest ways to
represent important time series data. There are 7 handy temporal
visualization styles for your time series data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Line Graph}. A line graph is the simplest way to represent time
  series data. It is intuitive, easy to create, and helps the viewer get
  a quick sense of how something has changed over time.
\item
  \emph{Stacked Area Chart} is an area chart similar to a line chart. In
  an area chart, multiple variables are ``stacked'' on top of each
  other, and the area below each line is colored to represent each
  variable.
\item
  \emph{Bar Charts} represent data as horizontal or vertical bars. The
  length of each bar is proportional to the value of the variable at
  that point in time. A bar chart is the right choice for you when you
  wish to look at how the variable moved over time or when you wish to
  compare variables versus each other. Grouped or stacked bar charts
  help you combine both these purposes in one chart while keeping your
  visualization simple and intuitive.
\item
  A \emph{Gantt Chart} is a horizontal bar chart showing work completed
  in a certain period of time with respect to the time allocated for
  that particular task. It is named after the American engineer and
  management consultant Henry Gantt who extensively used this framework
  for project management.
\item
  A \emph{Stream Graph} is essentially a stacked area graph, but
  displaced around a central horizontal axis. The stream graph looks
  like flowing liquid, hence the name.
\item
  \emph{Heat Map} Geo-spatial visualizations often use heat maps since
  they quickly help identify ``Hot spots'' or regions of high
  concentrations of a given variable. When adapted to temporal
  visualizations, heat maps can help us explore two levels of time in a
  2D array.
\item
  \emph{Polar Area Diagram}. Think beyond the straight line! Sometimes,
  time series data can be cyclical -- a season in a year, time of the
  day, and so on. Polar area diagrams help represent the cyclical nature
  time series data cleanly. A polar diagram looks like a traditional pie
  chart, but the sectors differ from each other not by the size of their
  angles but by how far they extend out from the center of the circle.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:aya-stacked} is a stacked area chart showing time series
data:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/aya-stacked} 

}

\caption{Student enrollments in India from 2001-10. (Source: [@aya-time-series])}\label{fig:aya-stacked}
\end{figure}

Stacked area charts are useful to show how both a cumulative total and
individual components of that total changed over time.

The order in which we stack the variables is crucial because there can
sometimes be a difference in the actual plot versus human perception.
The chart plots the value vertically whereas we perceive the value to be
at right angles to the general direction of the chart. For instance, in
the figure below, a bar graph would be a cleaner alternative.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/aya-stacked-perception} 

}

\caption{Human perception vs actual value. (Source: [@aya-time-series])}\label{fig:aya-stacked-perception}
\end{figure}

For instance, this grouped bar chart in this interactive visualization
of number of deaths by disease type in India not only lets you compare
the deaths due to diarrhea, malaria, and acute respiratory disease
across time, but also lets you compare the number of deaths by these
three diseases in a given year. By switching to the stacked bar chart
view, you get an intuitive sense of the proportion of deaths caused by
each disease.

}

\caption{Two different bar charts to represent time series data. (Source: [@aya-time-series])}\label{fig:aya-bar}
\end{figure}

To avoid clutter and confusion, make sure to not use more than 3
variables in a stacked or group bar chart. It is also a good practice to
use consistent bold colors and leave appropriate space between two bars
in a bar chart. Also, check out our blog on 5 common mistakes that lead
to bad data visualization to learn why the base axis for your bar charts
should start from zero.

\end{figure}

Assume you're planning the logistics for a dance concert. There are lots
of activities to be completed, some of which will take place
simultaneously while some can be done only after another activity has
been completed. For instance, the choreographers, soundtrack, and
dancers need to be finalized before the choreography can begin. However,
the costumes, props, and stage decor can be planned at the same time as
the choreography. With careful preparation, Gantt charts can help you
plan for complex, long-term projects that are likely to undergo several
revisions and have various resource and task dependencies.

Gantt charts are a popular project management tool since they present a
concise snapshot of various tasks spread across various phases of the
project. You can show additional information such as the correlation
between individual tasks, resources used in each task, overlapping
resources, etc., by the use of colors and placement of bars in a Gantt
chart.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/aya-stream} 

}

\caption{A stream graph showing a randomly chosen listener's last.fm music-listening habits over time. (Source: [@aya-time-series])}\label{fig:aya-stream}
\end{figure}

Stream graphs are great to represent and compare time series data for
multiple variables. Stream graphs are, thus, apt for large data sets.
Remember that choice of colors is very important, especially when there
are lots of variables. Variables that do not have significantly high
values might tend to get drowned out in the visualization if the colors
are not chosen well.

This heat map visualizes birthdays for babies born in the United States
between 1973 and 1999. The vertical axis represents the 31 days in a
month while the horizontal axis represents the 12 months in a year. This
chart quickly helps us identify that a large number of babies were born
in the later half of July, August, and September.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/aya-heat-map} 

}

\caption{Heat map can be useful to present 2-D time data. (Source: [@aya-time-series])}\label{fig:aya-heat-map}
\end{figure}

Heat maps are perfect for a two-tiered time frame -- for instance, 7
days of the week spread across 52 weeks in the year, or 24 hours in a
day spread across 30 days of the month, and so on. The limitation,
though, is that only one variable can be visualized in a heat map.
Comparison between two or more variables is very difficult to represent.

This popular polar area diagram created by Florence Nightingale shows
causes of mortality among British troops in the Crimean War. Each color
in the diagram represents a different cause of death. (Check out the the
text legend for more details.)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/aya-polar} 

}

\caption{Source: [@aya-time-series]}\label{fig:aya-polar}
\end{figure}

Polar area diagrams are useful for representing seasonal or cyclical
time series data, such as climate or seasonal crop data. Multiple
variables can be neatly stacked in the various sectors of the pie.

It is crucial to clarify whether the variable is proportional to the
area or radius of the sector. It is a good practice to have the area of
the sectors proportional to the value being represented. In that case,
the radius should be proportional to the square root of the value of the
variable (since area of a circle is proportional to the square of the
radius).

\section{5 Tips to improve Data
Visualization}\label{tips-to-improve-data-visualization}

\subsection{Comparison}\label{comparison}

Include a zero baseline if possible Although a line chart does not have
to start at a zero baseline, it should be included if it gives more
context for comparison. If relatively small fluctuations in data are
meaningful (e.g., in stock market data), you may truncate the scale to
showcase these variances; Always choose the most efficient
visualization; Watch your placement You may have two nice stacked bar
charts that are meant to let your reader compare points, but if they're
placed too far apart to ``get'' the comparison, you've already lost;
Tell the whole story. Maybe you had a 30\% sales increase in Q4.
Exciting! But what's more exciting? Showing that you've actually had a
100\% sales increase since Q1.

\subsection{Copy}\label{copy}

Don't over explain If the copy already mentions a fact, the subhead,
callout, and chart header don't have to reiterate it; Keep chart and
graph headers simple and to the point There's no need to get clever,
verbose, or pun-tastic. Keep any descriptive text above the chart brief
and directly related to the chart underneath. Remember: Focus on the
quickest path to comprehension; Use callouts wisely Callouts are not
there to fill space. They should be used intentionally to highlight
relevant information or provide additional context; Don't use
distracting fonts or elements Sometimes you do need to emphasize a
point. If so, only use bold or italic text to emphasize a point---and
don't use them both at the same time.

\subsection{Color}\label{color}

Use a single color to represent the same type of data; Watch out for
positive and negative numbers Don't use red for positive numbers or
green for negative numbers. Those color associations are so strong it
will automatically flip the meaning in the viewer's mind; Make sure
there is sufficient contrast between colors; Avoid patterns Stripes and
polka dots sound fun, but they can be incredibly distracting. If you are
trying to differentiate, say, on a map, use different saturation of the
same color. On that note, only use solid-colored lines (not dashes);
Select colors appropriately; Don't use more than 6 colors in a single
layout.

\subsection{Ordering}\label{ordering}

Order data intuitively There should be a logical hierarchy. Order
categories alphabetically, sequentially, or by value; Order
consistently; Order evenly Use natural increments on your axes (0, 5,
10, 15, 20) instead of awkward or uneven increments (0, 3, 5, 16, 50).

\subsection{Audience perspective}\label{audience-perspective}

Let the users lead;Know your audience,Designers should consider the way
users prefer to understand information, even in choosing basic analytic
approaches. For users to feel comfortable adopting and sharing insights
from analytics, they must be able to explain and defend the data.

\subsection{Use layers to tell a
story}\label{use-layers-to-tell-a-story}

While style is one form of customization, layering unique data sets on a
single visualization can tell a richer narrative and connect users to
the data without getting too crowded. On a map, this can be as simple as
zooming in and out, but it can also involve drill-downs (choosing a data
point and expanding it to show more detail), links and other shortcuts.

\subsection{Keep it simple}\label{keep-it-simple}

Analytic results shouldn't be presented to 10 decimal places when the
user doesn't need that level of precision to make a decision or
understand a concept. Effective visual interfaces avoid 3-D effects or
ornate gauge designs (a.k.a. ``chart junk'') when simple numbers, maps
or graphs will do.

\section{Word Cloud}\label{word-cloud}

A Word Cloud or Tag Cloud is a visual representation of text data in the
form of tags, which are typically single words whose importance is
visualized by way of their size and color. It displays how frequently
words appear in a given body of text, by making the size of each word
proportional to its frequency.

Word clouds can add clarity during text analysis in order to effectively
communicate your data results.It is an effective tool for Q researchers,
marketers, Non-profits, Human resources ,Educators, Politicians and
journalists.

** Pros of Word Clouds **

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  It is easy to understand and make an impact.
\item
  It can easily be shared.
\item
  It is visually engaging than a table data.
\item
  It is fast and reveals the essential.
\item
  They delight and provide emotional connection..
\end{enumerate}

** Cons of Word Clouds **

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Emphasis based on length of the words.
\item
  Words whose letters contain many ascenders and descenders may receive
  more attention.
\item
  They're not very accurate.
\item
  Lot of data cleaning required before generating word cloud.
\item
  Context is lost.
\end{enumerate}

\citep{wordcloud}

** Ways of generating a word cloud **

\textbf{R:} The procedure of creating word clouds is very simple in R
with text mining package (tm) and the word cloud generator package. The
major steps involved are: text mining which involves text cleaning and
transformation, building term-document matrix and generating word cloud
\citep{r}. \textbf{Wordle:} Wordle is a toy for generating ``word
clouds'' from text that you provide.It is very popular, free and easy to
use. You do need Java though Chrome. In Wordle, you generate word clouds
from text you input. Clouds can be tweaked with different color schemes,
layouts, and fonts. Images created from this tool can be saved and
reused \citep{wordle}.

Other popular tools include ABCya, Tagul, Tag Crowd, CloudArt.

\subsection{Calendar View}\label{calendar-view}

(Reproducible code for reference)

\citep{Calendar_Layout} We have all seen the calendar views in the
various data products that we worked on. Please find below an open
source code that I found, this will help you replicate and create your
own calendar: \citep{CalendarView}

This example demonstrates loading of CSV data, which is then quantized
into a diverging color scale. The values are visualized as colored cells
per day. Days are arranged into columns by week, then grouped by month
and years.

to tell stories using data visualization' / `exploratory data
visualization'}{An example to back some of our theories on how to tell stories using data visualization / exploratory data visualization}}\label{an-example-to-back-some-of-our-theories-on-how-to-tell-stories-using-data-visualization-exploratory-data-visualization}

\citep{DataUSA} MIT Media Lab in collaboration with Deloitte has created
a new visualization tool, that aggregates US government open source data
from various sources and mines information to generate trends and
stories about cities, jobs, industries etc. to the common man. Just
looking at any of the open data sources would give us an idea about the
vastness (breadth and depth) of the available data. It is amazing to see
how they have brought it all together on a single platform in a very
easy to decipher format. What caught my attention here is the
categorization of Information on the website that enables the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Easy browsing of various categories of information available at a
  single glance
\item
  Easy search on any topic of interest and get deeper information on
  each
\item
  Logical construction of information using data and visuals under each
  category
\item
  Comparative Analysis of cities
\item
  Variety of exploratory visualizations to learn from
\item
  Most important - Stories that these data tell For e.g.~Evolution of
  the American Worker, Poverty is bad for your health, Men still
  dominate in the highest paying industries, Opioid addiction damage and
  so many others.
\end{enumerate}

We think of a topic, and its possible it's there! Value add to students,
organizations, governments etc. is better understanding of your
consumers, talent pool, jobs, climate, and what not, that just improves
our decision-making ability manifold by spending just a few seconds on
the website And for this class, the best part is that the data is also
available for download. So, we can easily download this data, replicate
the visuals and try to redesign and tell our own stories with this data.
There is also other similar websites, that has some good visualizations
on census data: \citep{CensusDataViz}

\url{https://flowingdata.com/2017/04/07/automatic-visualization-is-a-bad-idea-generally-speaking/}

\url{https://yseop.com/blog/automation-making-data-visualization-smarter/}

\url{http://blog.avenuecode.com/a-ui-engineers-thoughts-on-data-visualization-tools}

\url{https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-data-visualization}

Plug in any data set into a magic box and it spits out a lovely
visualization you can show all of your co-workers, friends, and family.
That's the promise of a lot of start ups, but it doesn't quite work that
way. The goal of data visualization tools was to make understanding data
easier, but more often than not it doesn't quite go to plan. The problem
is that graphics alone don't fully explain data, and so we are inundated
with queries: why did the numbers fall in whatever month? Data
visualization can't explain data, leaving room for interpretation.

Although simple visualizations such as standard chart types (bar chart,
line chart etc.) are already automated to a certain extend in Microsoft
Office tools and other software available in the market, but full on
automation where insight fountains out from any data set is far-fetched
at this point, because this requires automatic analysis. Automated
analysis here means that the tool or algorithm has to understand the
context and also select the best visualization.

The focus in today's world has been on open source tools and
technologies and these tools although being free for most part require
more effort to seamlessly integrate to the current visualization
workflow. As mentioned in one of the articles about D3.js:

D3.js is one of the first data visualization tools that comes to mind
when talking about free, open-source alternatives. It's a JavaScript
based library for creating web visualization and displays the results on
the web page. However, with great power comes great responsibility.
D3.js is extremely powerful and flexible, because it allows you to build
amazing things with it, but as a trade-off, it's not the easiest tool to
use, so you might need to spend some time going through the helpful
library documentation.

At the end its not only about the tool its more about what you are
trying to do; what your professor, client, business or whatever needs.

\section{Reusable Data Visualization Code in
R}\label{reusable-data-visualization-code-in-r}

\citep{viz_R}

This site includes full sets of R code to generate specific types of
graphs in ggplot2. Plots in ggplot2 are created by using ``layering''.
There is a base plot and then other aspects of the plot such as
aesthetics, titles and labels are added on using extra code. For those
who favor Python for data viz, this layering approach in R is actually
similar to the syntax in Python's matplotlib library, in which
set\_style and specifying the axes labels and title are done separately
from the code that generates the plot itself.

To provide an example the ``layering'' mentioned above, here is a
generic snippet of code for creating a scatterplot with ggplot2 and the
mtcars data set in R base, using this website's code as a template:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}

\KeywordTok{theme_set}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{theme_bw}\NormalTok{())  }\CommentTok{#set background theme}

\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(plot1)  }\CommentTok{#we have to actually call the plot() function on the plot object we created}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{Data_Viz_Reader_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}
The ggplot2 package allows R users to go beyond the simple and often
rudimentary-looking graphs in R and offers many ways of customizing data
visualizations. In a way, the layering technique also makes it easier to
remember the code to generate these plots, since geom functions for the
layers remain constant and they are all included in a single line of
code.

\section{Data Mining and Data
Visualization}\label{data-mining-and-data-visualization}

\url{https://www.educba.com/data-mining-vs-data-visualization/}

This article gives me a clear understanding of data mining and data
visualization.

In Data Mining, there are different processes involve carrying out the
data mining process such as data extraction, data management, data
transformations, data pre-processing, etc. In Data Visualization, the
primary goal is to convey the information efficiently and clearly
without any deviations or complexities in the form of statistical
graphs, information graphs, and plots. Also, the author listed the top 7
comparisons between data mining and data visualization, and 12 key
differences between data mining and data visualization. After reading
the article, you will have a very clear understanding of what are data
mining and data visualization and the characters for those two
techniques.

\chapter{Ethics}\label{ethics}

\section{Ethical Theory and Practice from Journalism and
Engineering}\label{ethical-theory-and-practice-from-journalism-and-engineering}

\citep{poli_social_science} Over the years, researchers and lawyers have
come up with rules and practices for proper data collection and
utilization, with particular attention on human subject research.
Consent of the subjects to use their data, evaluation of any risk with
use or collection of data, and protecting anonymity of data are some of
the rules that must be considered for ethical research methods. Under
U.S. law, research institutions receiving federal funding, must consider
ethical aspects of their research. These rules continue to evolve.

Data presented in charts can persuade viewers on the subject matter,
even if viewers do not support the idea presented. This means that
visualizations can also be used to deceive and there are many techniques
for this leading viewers to wrong conclusions. Misleading,
incomprehensible, or incredible data visualization can jeopardize
people's trust, goodwill, or faith in research and advocacy on vital
human rights issues. Its ethical responsibility to create visualizations
to give correct and faithful representation of data and subjects.

The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient
graphical display for summarizing and reasoning about quantitative
information. And during the last decades, political science has
accumulated a large corpus of various kinds of data, which makes it
gradually become a more quantitative scientific field and requires using
quantitative information in the analysis and reasoning.

Data visualization plays several important roles in it:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  it helps create informative illustrations of the data, recapitulating
  large amount of quantitative information on a diagram;
\item
  it helps formulate new or supporting existing hypotheses from
  quantitative data;
\item
  it guides a statistical analysis of data and checks its validity.
\end{enumerate}

Some useful visualization methods are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Statistical graphics and infographics;
\item
  Geographical information systems (GIS);
\item
  Graph visualization or network maps;
\item
  Data cartography.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Importance of Ethics in
Visualization}\label{importance-of-ethics-in-visualization}

\citep{ethical_infographics}

Alberto Cairo addresses the ethical `why' of data visualization in this
article, while still grounding the discussion in straightforward
analysis of what to do and what not to do. He emphasizes that the
effectiveness of the communicative display is as important as the
information itself. This makes intuitive sense because useful
information is rendered utterly useless if no one can understand it.
Cairo sees data visualization as a harmonization of journalism and
engineering. From these two disciplines, he takes the journalist ethos
of truth-telling and honesty and combines this with an engineering focus
on efficacy and efficiency. The result is a data visualization that
contains accurate and relevant information which is clearly and
concisely conveyed. Cairo describes himself as a ``rule utilitarian''
and uses this to explain why it is ethical or, in his words, ``morally
right,'' to create graphics in this way. Here, it very useful to review
his blogpost introducing the article. Essentially, the goal is to create
the most good while doing the least harm. As such, conveying truthful
and honest relevant information increases a persons understanding.
Increased understanding and knowledge positively correlates with
personal well-being. The information presented must be accurate and
relevant. Cairo briefly addresses guidelines for this which are
applicable in all information gathering fields: beware of selection bias
when choosing preexisting datasets, validate the data, and include
important context. False or irrelevant information doesn't improve
anyone's decision-making capacity, so it cannot enhance well-being. Even
if the information is both accurate and relevant, moral engineering
pitfalls may remain. To avoid the unethical trap of inscrutable (or
misleading) graphics, Cairo exhorts us to take an evidenced based
approach when possible. The purpose of the graphic dictates the form it
takes; aesthetic preferences should never override clarity.Again, since
the ethical purpose is to improve well-being through understanding, a
graphic which is confusing or misleading is unethical, regardless of
intent, since it actually creates misunderstanding for the audience.
While it can be a bit jarring to think of a poorly designed graphic as
``morally wrong'', it is important to think of the unintended
consequences of visuals which have a powerful impact on their viewers.

\section{Implications of (Good/Bad) Data
Visualization}\label{implications-of-goodbad-data-visualization}

Raw data is often meaningless or their meaning is not easily concluded.
When people face a large set of measurements they are unable or
unwilling to spend the time required to process it. Our modern living
contributes to an ever-growing pool of ``big data'' and our ability to
collect this type of information becomes easier and easier. Thus
filtering, visualization, and interpretation of data become increasingly
important.

We should understand what to do with data, but first we should
understand why their presentation in graphical format is so powerful.

\textbf{1. Easy Recall}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
People can process images more quickly than words. When data is
transformed into images, the readability and cognition of the content
greatly improves. While people can only remember just 10\% of what they
hear and 20\% of what they read, retention jumps up to 80\% when they
for visual information with interaction.\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
With infographics you can pack a lot of information into a small space.

can be used to denote different aspects of the data allowing for
multi-layered understanding \citep{image_good}.\strut

Color, shape, sounds, and size can make evident relationships within
data very intuitive. When data points are represented as images or
components of an entire scene, readers are able to see the big picture
and understand how the information fits within a larger context.\strut

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{4. Increase in User Participation}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Interactive infographics can substantially increase the amount of time
someone will spend with the content. Because of their impact,
infographics are widely used nowadays. A quick google will produce a
huge array of great examples --- as well as poor ones. Because while
people recognize the value of information graphic design, and a number
of tools are available today that make the creation of them possible for
the layperson, it doesn't mean that they're all successful or even
necessary.\strut

\section{Misrepresentation through Data
Visualization}\label{misrepresentation-through-data-visualization}

While the ideal purpose of data visualization is to improve others'
understanding of the data presented, visualization can also be used to
mislead. Some of the main methods of doing so are omitting baselines,
axis manipulation, omitting data, and going against graphing convention.
Omitting baselines is used to imply a greater difference between two
categories, such as in poll results comparing political parties. Axis
manipulation by increasing the highest value on the y-axis affects the
visibility of a slope, making data with an otherwise visible trend
appear flat. Omitting selected data points or narrowing the window of a
graph is used to hide an overall trend, such as a graph of a stock only
showing a current trend and hiding previous bubbles. Graphs can also be
designed to subvert convention so that at first glance the graph is
conveying the opposite message, for example, by using the reader's
associations of colors and temperature to create a graph where hot is
blue and cold is red.

\section{General Guidelines to Ethical
Visuals}\label{general-guidelines-to-ethical-visuals}

\citep{ethics_code}

Data visualization is an up and coming field that currently doesn't have
many regulations. This makes it easy to manipulate readers without
technically reporting false information. However, certain standards
should be followed in order to generate meaningful visuals. The process
can be broken down into three steps, each with its own set of guiding
rules.

\textbf{1. Data Collection}

The first step in any project is gathering the data. This is relatively
simple and does not offer much of an opportunity to introduce confusion.
The one thing to remember is to always get data from a reliable source.
The data provides the foundation for the entire project and must
therefore be trustworthy and verifiable.

\textbf{2. Data Analysis}

This is the stage where the discoveries are made and provides the first
opportunity to manipulate the story for good or bad. There is usually a
lot of data cleaning to do before creating a visual representation, but
all manipulation should make sense. Code should be shared so anyone can
follow the entire process. It is also important to explicitly state any
assumptions taken, though these should be kept to a minimum.Here it is
important to look at what the source data actually shows.its ethical
responsibility of presenters for careful analysis of the data and find
true stories from them.

\textbf{3. Design}

Once a story is found, it must be presented in an honest way. This is
where deceptive techniques could be tempting to make a stronger
argument. An experienced individual will know how to spot these
deceptions and disregard any findings. This ultimately hurts the
credibility of the author and anyone else involved in the publication.

Visualization should not be used to intentionally hide or confuse the
truth, it should not mislead the uninformed. Visualization has got great
power and so does lots of responsibility.
