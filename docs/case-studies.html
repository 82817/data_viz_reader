<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Case Studies</h1>
<p>Visualization is like art; it speaks where words fail. There are phenomena like the Syrian war, the number flights during Thanksgiving in the USA, the understanding of depths for developing a perspective about the range of the issue, the controversy of ‘#OscarsSoWhite,’ etc. on which we can write endless paragraphs might still fail to convince the readers. The links below show some complex visualizations of some of these important and relevant topics - visualizations that speak volumes and are much more persuasive than an essay, with a tiny fraction of text. The usefulness of data visualizations is not just limited to business and analytics; visualizations can explain almost anything in the world. Wars, rescue operations, social issues, etc. can be visualized to get a bright idea of all the details of the issues.</p>
<p>This chapter contains some useful case studies on such visualizations. Case studies contain valuable information about development records. The examination and evaluation of case studies help show that new designs are just as usable as existing techniques, demonstrating that the field is suitable for future development. Many of the case studies below come from the following articles:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Geographic Visualizations</h2>
<p>Often, people use maps to visualize data that should not be mapped. Here are some examples of when a map visualization is a good choice.</p>
<div id="spies-in-the-skies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Spies in the Skies</h3>
<p>The map below is from a Buzzfeed article <span class="citation">[@spies_sky]</span> that shows how common it is for the government to observe people. It was filled with red and blue lines (representing FBI and DHS aircraft, respectively) which illustrate the flight paths of the planes. When planes circle an area more than once, the circles become darker. The circles change by day and time, and individual cities can be typed into a search bar to see the flight patterns over them. The visualization rather creatively looks almost like a hand-drawn map. While presenting an ordinarily uncomfortable topic, this allows individuals to check things for themselves, hopefully providing some peace of mind.</p>

<div id="two-centuries-of-u.s.-immigration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Two Centuries of U.S. Immigration</h3>
<p>This interactive map from <span class="citation">[@immigration]</span> shows the rate of immigration into the U.S. from other countries over the last 200 years in 10-year segments. Each colored dot represents 10,000 people coming from the specified country. Countries then light up when they have one of the highest rates of migration. A tracker on the left indicates what countries sent the most people to the U.S. at what times.</p>
<p>What makes this a good visualization is that it is engaging and easy to read and interpret. The movement of the dots draws the reader’s attention while the brightly lit countries make it easy to pick out the highest total migrations. The bright colors and dark background help the information stand out. This map is a bit simpler, but perhaps that is all it needs.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Uber: Crafting Data-Driven Maps</h3>
<p>Map visualization is essential for companies like Uber that need to track metrics using geo-space points. In this article, the designer from Uber talks about the challenges of designing such visualizations and the possible solutions <span class="citation">[@uber_maps]</span>.</p>
<p>The challenges that Uber faced when crafting geospatial visualizations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are great individual maps but as a whole lack of consistency across the company.</li>
<li>Common graphing tools like Sketch does not support GIS file, which is essential to Uber’s insights.</li>
<li>The scale of the framework includes more than 400 cities in the world with a variety of different geographic features and data types.</li>
</ol>
<p>To tackle these problems, Uber started by defining base map themes by optimizing detail, color, and typography. Based on that, data layers are added using scatter plots and hex bins, with careful color selection to help their team make decisions. To make it even better, Uber took a further step by adding trip lines (see images below), which became a signature visualization of Uber. Choropleths are also used to help visualize how metrics and values differ across geographic areas. Uber uses US postal codes as geographic boundaries and infuses various datasets to create the color variation.</p>
<p>The visualization in this article is a classic problem of visualizing geographic data. The detailed explanation of the problems and how they are solved can be beneficial for people or startups trying to conceptualize and make appropriate visualizations that support the decision-making process.</p>

<div id="demographic-comparisons" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Demographic Comparisons</h2>
<p>One common use of visualization is to compare different groups against each other, such as political parties or generations.</p>
<div id="young-voters-class-and-turnout-how-britain-voted-in-2017" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Young voters, class and turnout: How Britain voted in 2017</h3>
<p>This article’s goal is to convey the change in party votes in the 2017 UK general election compared to votes in 2015 <span class="citation">[@UKvotes2017]</span>. The change in party votes was shown with regards to three demographic factors: age, class, and ethnicity. For each factor, there are four graphs (one per political party), each illustrated in the party’s standard color. The change in the percent of votes is shown as an arrow where the arrow’s shaft is the length of the difference from 2015 to 2017 while the x-axis is the demographic factor split into different bins.</p>
<p>What makes this a good visualization is that it is straightforward to read and interpret. The color-coding of the arrows and party names makes it easy to pick out the different parties. The index is smartly spread across the visualization to reduce cross-referencing, and color in the graph represents the actual party colors in the campaign. The arrow lengths highlight just how significant of a change happened. For example, in the Age section, it is easy to see the pattern between the Labour party gaining many voters aged 18 to 44 and the Conservative party gaining voters aged 45 and up.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> U.S. Migration Patterns</h3>
<p>The New York Times data team mapped out Americans’ moving patterns from 1900 to present, and the results are fascinating to interact with <span class="citation">[@migration]</span>. We can see where people living in each state were born, and where people are moving to and from. The groupings of the destinations vary based on that state’s trends, preventing unnecessary clutter while still showing detail when vital, as can be seen by the difference between the charts for California and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Overall, this type of chart can work well to visualize movement in data over time, such as with migration. However, it must be done carefully to maintain clarity. Too many categories with colors and crossing lines can make it difficult for a reader to keep track of what the data is saying and it can quickly go from a very graphic visualization to a chaotic mess of lines. The designer does a pretty good job with these visualizations by limiting the number of categories in grouping states by west, south, midwest, etc. However, it is not completely clear why so many crossing lines are necessary for the Pennsylvania chart. The crossing lines, along with the use of the same color for different lines within the same regional categories, can make it difficult for a reader to follow along with what the chart is trying to convey.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> The American Workday</h3>
<p>NPR tapped into American Time Use Survey data to ascertain the share of workers in a wide range of industries who are at work at any given time <span class="citation">[@NPR_workday]</span>. The original question of when Americans work, rather than the number of hours worked, is answered in the graph. The chart overlays the traditional 9 AM-5 PM standard workday as a reference point, helping the audience draw exciting conclusions. Below is a screenshot of the data product; the original graph is more interactive and allows the audience to explore when people are working for different occupations.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/npr_workday.png" />

</div>
<p>Some interesting findings include: 1. Construction workers both start and finish their workday earlier and generally do not work at lunch hours as there is a massive drop at noon.</p>
<p><img src="images/construction.png" /> 2. Servers and cooks’ schedule are the opposite of all other occupations with the peak from lunch through the evening.</p>
<p><img src="images/server_cook.png" /> 3. Protective services, e.g., police officers, firefighters and detectives, have many workers working throughout the night, which is entirely different from all other occupations.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/protective.png" />

</div>
<p>This data product is an excellent example because the analytic design has been applied to contrast specific occupations to the traditional 9-5 working hours. This is easy to understand and make particular occupations stand out more manageable. The use of color for highlighting the selected occupation in the graph helps to categorize different occupations as well.</p>

<p>This is an excellent example about how to present a significant amount of comprehensive data - distributed across different categories and measured in different metrics - in a simple yet effective manner, while still maintaining interest and aesthetics. The data product attempts to show how the average Briton’s diet has changed over the last four decades for the better <span class="citation">[@britain_diet_2016]</span>. It does this by displaying simple trend lines that show that more harmful and fatty foods are being consumed less while consumed more healthier and leaner foods. It further breaks down every major food category into tens of its constituent products, and in both the overview and deep-dive versions, provides further levers to massage more meaning out of the data. It also shows how the contribution of different foods to the typical diet has changed over the years. Here, we can toggle the year to see exactly how much of each food was consumed, again with another deep-dive into the constituents of every primary food group.</p>

It is difficult to use the same data product to cater to both types of viewers in such an adequate capacity, which is what makes this particular data product so impressive and useful.

<p>CNNMoney created an interactive chart using U.S. Census Data to show the size and diversity of the millennial generation compared to baby boomers <span class="citation">[@age_groups]</span>. While the article’s main point is that the millennial generation is bigger and more diverse than the baby boomer generation, it also contains information about all of the other living generations. It turns hard numbers into an intriguing story, illustrating the racial makeup of different age groups from 1913 to present.</p>
<p>The author also summarized three key findings from the graph: 1. The most common age in the US is 22 years old. 2. The median age in the US is 37.6 years old. 3. Among the youngest generation, only 50% of the population is white with the potential of dropping from the biggest race in the US.</p>

The plot is simple and easy to interpret, but it also includes a good number of variables including time, activity type, number of people doing each activity, and the order in which activities are done.</p>
<p>One of the plot’s biggest strengths is that by using one dot to represent each person in the study and using animation, we can drill down to the level of an individual and follow him or her throughout the day. The accumulation of dots for each particular activity also gives us an aggregate-level view of the same data, so we get both individual and aggregate insights.</p>
<p>A drawback of the plot is that it is hard for our eyes to keep track of 1000 simultaneously moving dots. The author of the post addresses this by creating subsequent plots with stationary lines at crucial times of the day.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.3</span> Understanding Plastic pollution using visualization</h3>
<p>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic products in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans. Human usage of plastic has increased manifolds in last few decades. Since plastic is inexpensive and durable, it has a wide variety of uses in our everyday life. Since the 1950’s, an estimated 6.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced, of which only about 9% is recycled <span class="citation">[@Wiki_Plastic_Pollution]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage of plastic in last few decades</strong> <span class="citation">[@Plastic_Pollution_visualizations]</span>: <img src="images/global_plastic_usage.png" /></p>
<p>Plastic has become part of our daily life, and human dependence on plastic has increased over time. Below shows some of the plastic products used day in day out by us undermining their effects on the environment. <span class="citation">[@Plastic_Pollution_visualizations]</span></p>
<p><strong>What is plastic used for.</strong> <span class="citation">[@Plastic_Pollution_visualizations]</span> <img src="images/use_of_plastic.png" /></p>
<p>With a share of 26 percent, China may be the largest plastic producer in the world - yet the largest plastic consumer is neighboring Japan. The people living in the island nation have consumption that exceeds even that of the entire rest of Asia and Africa combined.</p>

<p>This case study is about the use of linguistic concepts; it discusses how the data is being used and how visual graphics are used to deliver the central insights. It presents an educational tool that integrates computational linguistics resources for use in non-technical undergraduate language science courses. By using the tool in conjunction with case studies, it provides opportunities for students to gain an understanding of linguistic concepts and analysis through the lens of realistic problems in feasible ways <span class="citation">[@lingui_data]</span>.</p>
<p>HistoBankVis is a novel visualization system designed for the interactive analysis of complex, multidimensional data to facilitate historical linguistic work <span class="citation">[@lingui_data1]</span>. In this paper, the visualization’s efficacy and power are illustrated utilizing a concrete case study investigating the diachronic interaction of word order and subject case in Icelandic.</p>
<p>Much of what computational linguists fall back upon to improve natural language processing and model language “understanding” is the structure that has, at best, only an indirect attestation in observable data. The sheer complexity of these structures, and the observable patterns on which they are based, however, usually limit their accessibility, often even to the researchers creating or studying them. Traditional statistical graphs and custom-designed data illustrations fill the pages of CL papers, providing insight into linguistic and algorithmic structures, but visual ‘externalizations’ such as these are almost exclusively used in CL for presentation and explanation.</p>
<p>Visualizations can also be used as an aid in the process of research itself. There are particular statistical methods, falling under the rubric of “exploratory data analysis,” and visualization techniques just for this purpose. However, these are not widely used or even known in CL. These novel data visualization techniques offer the potential for creating new methods that reveal structure and detail in data. Visualization can provide new methods for interacting with large corpora, complex linguistic structures, and can lead to a better understanding of the states of stochastic processes.</p>

<p>The Visualizing Urban Data Idealab (VUDlab) out of the University of California-Berkeley put together this visual representation of data that disproves the claim in a 1973 suit that charged the school with sex discrimination. Though the graduate schools had accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants, researchers later uncovered that if the data were properly pooled, there was a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. This is called a Simpson’s Paradox. By “properly pooled,” the investigators meant broken down by the department. For instance, men were more inclined towards science and women towards humanities. When compared to each other, the science departments required more specialized skills while the humanities would accept applicants with a more standard undergrad curriculum, thus creating the Simpson’s Paradox.</p>

<p>The original visualization effectively shows the seasonality of malaria cases but is unclear if the two reporting categories are stacked or one behind the other (and is rather garish). The creator of the redesign made the seasonality more obvious by combining the reporting categories. The author has attempted to improve to show the overall decline clearly and explained the spikes better. Furthermore, by adding the yearly data split by districts， we can lead to a possible actionable solution to the study of Malaria cases in Zambia which is exactly an important objective of visualization. Besides, we can notice the power of an informative dashboard with a strong argument. The author has combined the data to find out what the data looks like when combined with health facilities and health workers.

As the reader hovers over a tree or bar segment, the connected sections light up, making it easier for the reader to look at what otherwise could have been a very dense chart.</p>
<p>We can see what some of the familiar and uncommon trees planted in the five boroughs of New York City are. This visualization allows one to see the distribution quickly. One can make inferences based on the distribution, such as trees in the Bronx and Manhattan seem to be distributed more uniformly compared to the other three boroughs. It gives a direct comparison between the five boroughs which could be used to make a compelling decision by the audience.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.6</span> Adding up the White Oscars Winners</h3>
<p>A visualization of all previous winners of the Best Actor/Actress Oscar winners can be seen in an article by Bloomberg <span class="citation">[@adding_oscars]</span>. From the attributes of past Oscars winners, the authors have developed a set of attributes that they believe will continue to be prevalent in future Oscar winners. It is fascinating to see how the article shows the features of the Best Actress, Actor, movies, etc. in a simple and captivating visual.</p>
<p>The visualization is interactive, and we can click on each attribute like ‘Hair Color,’ ‘Eye Color,’ etc. to see the features of the actors and actresses who are likely to win the Oscars. Based on different attributes selected, the visualization changes to give you the data specific to the attributes. For each attribute selected, it gives you a fact about the selected attribute related to the Oscar Winner. For instance, when you select the race, it states “In the entire history of the Oscars all but 8 of the Best Actors and Best Actresses have been white”. Similarly, the visualization also gives information about the different aspects of movies that are more likely to win, like ‘Length,’ ‘Month,’ ‘Budget,’ etc. and also predict about the future nominees who are likely to win Oscar.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.11</span> Visualization of big data security: a case study on the KDD99 cup data set</h3>
<p>This paper utilized a visualization algorithm together with significant data analysis to gain better insights into the KDD99 dataset:</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
Cybersecurity has been thrust into the limelight in the modern technological era because of an array of attacks often bypassing new intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Therefore, deciphering better methods for identifying attack types to train IDSs more effectively has become a field of great interest. Critical cyber-attack insights exist in big data; however, an efficient approach is required to determine strong attack types to train IDSs to become more active in critical areas. Despite the rising growth in IDS research, there is a lack of studies involving big data visualization, which is crucial. The KDD99 dataset has served as a reliable benchmark since 1999; therefore, this dataset was utilized in the experiment. This study utilized a hash algorithm, a weight table, and sampling method to deal with the inherent problems caused by analyzing big data: volume, variety, and velocity. By utilizing a visualization algorithm, the researchers were able to gain insights into the KDD99 dataset with precise identification of “normal” clusters and described distinct clusters of possible attacks.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.12</span> How Data Visualization is Helping in Healthcare Decision Making</h3>
<p><span class="citation">[@marksman]</span></p>
<p>Healthcare service providers are increasing their efforts to investigate different visual and interactive methods in creating and examining large graphs, charts, interactive visualizations, and 2D/3D visualization of discrete event simulation (DES) to comprehend complex and large datasets, recognize connections and trends, model and simulate healthcare events, and communicate and interpret the findings. Expected results include more efficient and effective clinical performance monitoring and improvement, patient flow modeling and management, better patient care quality, security and effectiveness, better support for clinical costing and resource coordination, better-planned development and competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Traditional visualization strategies often require significant processing time, which restrains high-throughput analysis. Interactive visualization frameworks maintain a closed loop between the user and the system and, thus, need to be very fast. Building such a framework requires the development of new visualization methods, and there exists the need to design new and useful interaction techniques which are being developed by researchers.</p>
<p>Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), an initiative sponsored by the NIH Roadmap National Centers for Biomedical Computing is another such program that provides a query tool that supplies aggregate counts and fundamental analyses of patient populations from clinical data warehouses (CDWs). i2b2 (i2b2 to Tableau) is useful in estimating patient cohort sizes and has an extendable design where modules with additional features can be developed. Other tools such as R and Python are also helping healthcare a lot.</p>
<p>Today, data visualization solutions can be found everywhere in healthcare systems from hospital operations monitoring and patient profiling to demand projection and capacity planning. Moreover, health informatics databases and networks have amplified benefits with information visualization as it dramatically expands the capacity of patients, clinicians, and public health policymakers to make better decisions.</p>

<div id="law-enforcement-and-fraud-detection" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.13</span> Law enforcement and fraud detection</h3>
<p>“Data is the new oil”– it may be a cliche, but it is true. Like oil, data in its raw, unrefined form is pretty worthless. To unlock its value, data needs to be refined, analyzed and understood <span class="citation">[@lawfraud]</span>. You can say the same about graphs. More and more organizations are seeing potential in their data connections. The question is, how do you get non-experts to analyze graphs at scale and understand potentially complex insight? Most of the time, the answer is through interactive graph visualization.</p>
<p>There are four reasons why graph visualization is such a powerful tool:</p>
<p><em>It is intuitive – presenting a graph as a node-link structure instantly makes sense, even to people who’ve never worked with graphs before. </em>It is fast – our brains are great at spotting patterns, but only when data is presented in a tangible format. Armed with visualization, we can spot trends and outliers very effectively. <em>It is flexible – the world is densely connected, so as long as there’s an interesting relationship in your data somewhere, you will find value in graph visualization. </em>It is insightful – exploring graph data interactively allows users to gain more in-depth knowledge, understand the context and ask more questions, compared to static visualization or raw data.</p>
<p>In a growing number of domains, graph visualization has become a must-have data analysis tool. Let’s take a quick look at the ways graph visualization is being used in real life.</p>
<p>The police have been using graph visualization, or link analysis as it is commonly known – for decades to ‘join the dots’ in investigations. What has changed is the use of technology to make joining the dots a more automated and scalable process.</p>
<p>A failure to analyze the bigger, joined-up picture was cited as a shortcoming of the intelligence services after the 9/11 terror attacks. In the years that followed, law enforcement and security agencies drove graph visualization forward. New approaches and technologies were explicitly created for large-scale data analysis of communications records, open source intelligence (OSINT), and police databases.</p>
<p>Lawful interception, the legally mandated interception of personal communications data, provided vast volumes of data on criminal and terrorist activity. Paired with social network analysis, graph visualization techniques allowed non-specialized staff to explore the data and uncover important insight.</p>
<p>Another early adopter of graph visualization techniques was the financial services industry. Fraud detection is about finding unusual connections – between accounts, transactions, insurance policies, devices, etc. There’s great value in visualizing that data as a graph. Known fraud detection is primarily automated with rule scoring and pattern matching. Visualization lets you review edge-cases and outliers more quickly. Speed is important because sometimes analysts only have seconds to approve or deny a transaction. In those cases, visualizations are simple, small and with limited interaction. To get a clear overview quickly, analysts need effective layouts. Other functionalities, like expanding and filtering help fraud analysts to see context on demand.</p>
<p>Three things are consistent across both graph visualization use cases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They involve highly connected data (apparently).</li>
<li>That highly connected data conceals risk insight.</li>
<li>That insight is needed to power quick and confident decision making.</li>
</ol>
<p>When connected data insight is critical, only interactive and robust visualization tools are up to the task.</p>
