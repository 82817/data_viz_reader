(Reference: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-graphs-for-data-visualization)

Using the correct type of graph can make the presentation more effective and deliver the message to the audience clearly. In this article, the author discussed 5 questions to ask before choosing the type of chart to use, common types of graph and their design best practices. 

The 5 questions we need to clarify so as to choose the right graph include:
1. Do we want to compare values?
2. Show composition of something?
3. Understand the distribution of data?
4. Analyzing trends of data?
5. Understand the relationship between value sets?

It is beneficial to ask ourselves these questions before jumping into all kinds of visuals as it helps understand the goal better. For our individual project, this article can serve as a guild line to review whether the charts are effective enough in terms of chart type and design practice.
