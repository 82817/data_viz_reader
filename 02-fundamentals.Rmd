  These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and
  then focus your visualization with respect to those questions. 
  
  Brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways – unconscious (System 1 represents
  uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 – represents controlled function
  such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System -1 which has can have quick and correct
  impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows: - 

** 1. Design and layout matter **
      The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer.
** 2.	Avoid Clutter **
      Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio – the ratio of ink required to convey
      the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That
      means, avoid ink which do not add any information.
** 3.	Use color purposely and effectively **
      Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists
      in conveying your message. 
      The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic
      in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above 
      principles.And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and 
      prescriptive.
