Here is free pdf to some best practices in visual analysis. It talks about the right charts to be used for various kinds of analysis. It is very relevant for data science students as we would be interested in presenting our analysis using simple and effective visualizations that tell the complete story. 

Some of key areas for which the author highlights some best practices are for visualizing trends over time, comparison and ranking, correlation, distribution, geographical data etc. 

The author gives examples on how simple graphs can also become more effective by just adding a few more elements or some simple adjustments. 

I feel this is a great starting point to create effective charts and we may use these principles also when we start doing advanced analytics.
