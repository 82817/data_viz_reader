    1.  Fundamental Components of Design
          
          Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and 
          unity as the design foundation of any work. If you want to take your data visualization from an 
          everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the 9 principles of design from graphic 
          designer Melissa Anderson's article:
                  https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/07/26/data-visualization-and-the-9-fundamental-design-principles/
  
          Balance doesn't mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the
          elements of the dashboard/visualiaztion distributed evenly. And it important to remember the non-data elements, such
          as a logo, title, caption, etc., that can affect the balance of the display. 
          
          Another closely related component to balance is variety which could seem counter to balance, but when done
          correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel
          cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.
          
          Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to
          enhancing a viewer's experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be
          easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the
          dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results
          and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on
          the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and 
          remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.
          
          Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through the nine principles of design in this
          article. From prior experience with art through photography I understand it is key to be concious of what I am 
          drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very
          important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the
          viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.
