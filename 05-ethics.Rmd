   The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient graphical display for summarizing and reasoning about    quantitative information. And during the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of various kinds      of data, which makes it gradually become a more quantitative scientific field and requires using quantitative information      in the analysis and reasoning. 

   Data visualization plays several important roles in it: 1) helps create informative illustrations of the data,                recapitulating large amount of quantitative information on a diagram; 2) helps formulate new or supporting existing            hypotheses from quantitative data; 3) guides a statistical analysis of data and checks its validity.

   Some useful visualization methods are: 1) _Statistical graphics and infographics_; 2) _Geographical information systems        (GIS)_; 3) _Graph visualization or network maps_; 4) _Data cartography_.
